        <h1>Passwords</h1>
        <div>
          <p>To protect network devices, it is important to use strong passwords. Here are standard guidelines to follow:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use a password length of at least 8 characters, preferably 10 or more characters. A longer password is a better password.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Make passwords complex. Include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces, if allowed. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Avoid passwords based on repetition, common dictionary words, letter or number sequences, usernames, relative or pet names, biographical information, such as birthdates, ID numbers, ancestor names, or other easily identifiable pieces of information.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Deliberately misspell a password. For example, Smith = Smyth = 5mYth or Security = 5ecur1ty.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Change passwords often. If a password is unknowingly compromised, the window of opportunity for the attacker to use the password is limited.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do not write passwords down and leave them in obvious places such as on the desk or monitor.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The figure shows examples of strong and weak passwords.</p>
          <p>On Cisco routers, leading spaces are ignored for passwords, but spaces after the first character are not. Therefore, one method to create a strong password is to use the space bar and create a phrase made of many words. This is called a passphrase. A pass phrase is often easier to remember than a simple password. It is also longer and harder to guess.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows two tables; one table contains weak passwords and the reasons why they are weak.  Reasons include it is a simple dictionary word, a mother's maiden name, a make of car, or other simple words.  The other table contains strong passwords that are made from a combination of letters numbers and symbols.  They appear random.</div>
