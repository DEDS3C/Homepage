        <h1>IP Addressing Issues on IOS Devices</h1>
        <div>
          <p>IP address-related problems will likely keep remote network devices from communicating. Because IP addresses are hierarchical, any IP address assigned to a network device must conform to that network’s range of addresses. Wrongly assigned IP addresses create a variety of issues, including IP address conflicts and routing problems.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Two common causes of incorrect IPv4 assignment are manual assignment mistakes or DHCP-related issues.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Network administrators often have to manually assign IP addresses to devices such as servers and routers. If a mistake is made during the assignment, then communications issues with the device are very likely to occur.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>On an IOS device, use the <b>show ip interface</b> or <b>show ip interface brief</b> commands to verify what IPv4 addresses are assigned to the network interfaces. The figure displays the output of the <b>show ip interface</b> command issued on a R1. Notice that the output displays IPv4 information (OSI Layer 3), while the previously mentioned <b>show interfaces</b> command displays the physical and data link details of an interface.</p>

      <div id="media-description"> Figure shows a topology with a PC, a switch, and three routers. The PC is connected to the switch, which is connected to router R1, which is connected to router R2, which is connected to router R3. Below the topology is the command output for ‘show ip interface gigabitethernet0/0’ with the IP address highlighted. </div>
