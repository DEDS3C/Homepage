        <h1>Traffic Management</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The network administrator should consider the various types of traffic and their treatment in the network design. The routers and switches in a small network should be configured to support real-time traffic, such as voice and video, in a distinct manner relative to other data traffic. In fact, a good network design will classify traffic carefully according to priority, as shown in the figure. In the end, the goal for a good network design, even for a small network, is to enhance the productivity of the employees and minimize network downtime.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure shows a tall router that has been sectioned into different types of traffic.  At the bottom of the router is FTP traffic, then above that is Instant Messaging, then SMTP, and finally at the top is Voice.  This figure is demonstrating how routers can prioritize traffic before sending to the backbone.</div>
