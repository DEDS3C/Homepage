            <b>Note</b>: Students can work singularly, in pairs, or the full classroom can complete this activity together.</p>
          <p>Take a look at the two networks in the diagram. Visually compare and contrast the two networks. Make note of the devices used in each network design. Since the devices are labeled, you already know what types of end devices and intermediate devices are on each network. </p>
          <p>How are the two networks different? Is it just that there are more devices present on Network B than on Network A?</p>
          <p>Select the network you would use if you owned a small to medium-sized business. Be able to justify your selected network based on cost, speed, ports, expandability, and manageability.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure shows two networks.  Network A consists of a PC connected to router six, which is connected to router seven.  Router seven is connected to a server.  Network B consists of a PC connected to a switch.  The switch is connected to router three. Router three is connected to Router four with a serial connection. Router three is also connected to router five with an Ethernet connection.  Router five is also connected to router four with an Ethernet connection.  Router four is connected to a server, and router five is connected to a wireless router that has a tablet connected to it.</div>
