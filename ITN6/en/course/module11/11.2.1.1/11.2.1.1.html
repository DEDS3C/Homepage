        <h1>Types of Threats</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Whether wired or wireless, computer networks are essential to everyday activities. Individuals and organizations alike depend on their computers and networks. Intrusion by an unauthorized person can result in costly network outages and loss of work. Attacks on a network can be devastating and can result in a loss of time and money due to damage or theft of important information or assets. </p>
          <p>Intruders can gain access to a network through software vulnerabilities, hardware attacks or through guessing someone's username and password. Intruders who gain access by modifying software or exploiting software vulnerabilities are often called hackers. </p>
          <p>After the hacker gains access to the network, four types of threats may arise, as shown in the figure. Click each image for more information.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure is an interactive activity that shows four pictures.  One picture is of a folder with a caption of Information Theft. One picture is of a hammer and a hard drive with a caption of Data Loss and Manipulation. One picture is of a check register and credit card with a caption of Identity Theft. One picture is of a computer with a bug on the screen and a 404 error "Page not found".  These pictures are all focused on network security.  When you click each of the pictures, a callout displays a description of the caption along with information and examples.</div>
