        <h1>Types of Vulnerabilities</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Vulnerability is the degree of weakness which is inherent in every network and device. This includes routers, switches, desktops, servers, and even security devices. Typically, the network devices under attack are the endpoints, such as servers and desktop computers.</p>
          <p>There are three primary vulnerabilities or weaknesses: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Technological, as shown in Figure 1</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Configuration, as shown in Figure 2</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Security policy, as shown in Figure 3</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>All three of these vulnerabilities or weaknesses can lead to various attacks, including malicious code attacks and network attacks.</p>

      <iframe id="media" title="interactive graphic" aria-label="interactive graphic" aria-describedby="media-description"></iframe>
      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 lists weaknesses for TCP/IP, Operating systems, and Network equipment. Figure 2 matches configuration weaknesses with a way in which to exploit that weakness.  These weaknesses include unsecure user accounts, system accounts with weak passwords, misconfigured Internet services, unsecure default settings, and misconfigured equipment. Figure 3 lists policy weaknesses and ways in which to exploit them.  Policy weaknesses include a lack of written security policy, lack of authentication policy, and disaster recovery plan.</div>
