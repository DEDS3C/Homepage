          <p>
            <b>Additional Password Security</b>
          </p>
          <p>Strong passwords are only as useful as they are secret. There are several steps that can be taken to help ensure that passwords remain secret. Using the global configuration command <b>service password-encryption</b> prevents unauthorized individuals from viewing passwords in plain text in the configuration file, as shown in the figure. This command causes the encryption of all passwords that are unencrypted. </p>
          <p>Additionally, to ensure that all configured passwords are a minimum of a specified length, use the <b>security passwords min-length</b> command in global configuration mode.</p>
          <p>Another way hackers learn passwords is simply by brute-force attacks, trying multiple passwords until one works. It is possible to prevent this type of attack by blocking login attempts to the device if a set number of failures occur within a specific amount of time. </p>
          <p>Router(config)# <b>login block-for 120 attempts 3 within 60</b></p>
          <p>This command will block login attempts for 120 seconds if there are three failed login attempts within 60 seconds. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Exec Timeout</b>
          </p>
          <p>Another recommendation is setting executive timeouts. By setting the exec timeout, you are telling the Cisco device to automatically disconnect users on a line after they have been idle for the duration of the exec timeout value. Exec timeouts can be configured on console, VTY, and aux ports using the <b>exec-timeout</b> command in line configuration mode. </p>
          <p>Router(config)# <b>line vty 0 4</b></p>
          <p>Router(config-line)# <b>exec-timeout 10 </b></p>
          <p>This command configures the device to disconnect idle users after 10 minutes.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure shows router output for configuring encrypted line passwords and setting restrictions on password length or failed attempts. Commands entered include “security password-encryption”, “security password min-length 8”, login block-for 120 attempts 3 within 60”, and “exec-timeout 10” on the VTY lines.</div>
