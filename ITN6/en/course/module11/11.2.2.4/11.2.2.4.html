        <h1>Denial of Service Attacks</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are the most publicized form of attack and also among the most difficult to eliminate. Even within the attacker community, DoS attacks are regarded as trivial and considered bad form because they require so little effort to execute. But because of their ease of implementation and potentially significant damage, DoS attacks deserve special attention from security administrators.</p>
          <p>DoS attacks take many forms. Ultimately, they prevent authorized people from using a service by consuming system resources.</p>
          <p>Click the buttons in the figure to see examples of DoS and DDoS attacks.</p>
          <p>To help prevent DoS attacks it is important to stay up to date with the latest security updates for operating systems and applications. For example, the ping of death is no longer a threat because updates to operating systems have fixed the vulnerability that it exploited.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows different Denial of Service attacks and shows how the resource overload affects the data. Figure 2 shows an attacker sending a ping of death packet to a host.  The malformed packet overloads the host and renders the host unresponsive. Figure 3 demonstrates a syn flood attack.  In this figure the attacker is sending multiple syn packets to a web server.  The attacker does not complete the transaction and when a valid user sends a syn request, the server is unavailable. Figure 4 shows an attacker connected to many servers acting as zombies or agents for a denial of service attack.  The agents launch the attack on a single host and render it unavailable. Figure 5 shows an attacker connected to a router acting as a smurf amplifier.  The amplifier tells many zombie computers to send an ICMP reply to a single host.  This overwhelms the destination.</div>
