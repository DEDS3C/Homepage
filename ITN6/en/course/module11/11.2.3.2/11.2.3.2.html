        <h1>Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA, or “triple A”) network security services provide the primary framework to set up access control on a network device. AAA is a way to control who is permitted to access a network (authenticate), what they can do while they are there (authorize), and what actions they perform while accessing the network (accounting). </p>
          <p>The concept of AAA is similar to the use of a credit card. The credit card identifies who can use it, how much that user can spend, and keeps account of what items the user spent money on, as shown in the figure. </p>

These two items represent Authorization and Accounting.  The credit card has the name on the card and the card number highlighted.  This represents Authentication.  These are part of triple A or AAA.</div>
