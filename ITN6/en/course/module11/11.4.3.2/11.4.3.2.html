        <h1>IP Addressing Issues on End Devices</h1>
        <div>
          <p>In Windows-based machines, when the device cannot contact a DHCP server, Windows will automatically assign an address belonging to the 169.254.0.0/16 range. This process is designed to facilitate communication within the local network. Think of it as Windows saying “I will use this address from the 169.254.0.0/16 range because I could not get any other address”. More often than not, a computer with a 169.254.0.0/16 will not be able to communicate with other devices in the network because those devices will most likely not belong to the 169.254.0.0/16 network. This situation indicates an automatic IPv4 address assignment problem that should be fixed.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Other operating systems, such Linux and OS X, will not assign an IPv4 address to the network interface if communication with a DHCP server fails.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Most end devices are configured to rely on a DHCP server for automatic IPv4 address assignment. If the device is unable to communicate with the DHCP server, then the server cannot assign an IPv4 address for the specific network and the device will not be able to communicate.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To verify the IP addresses assigned to a Windows-based computer, use the <b>ipconfig</b> command, as shown in the figure.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows a topology with a PC, a switch, and three routers. The PC is connected to the switch, which is connected to router R1, which is connected to router R2, which is connected to router R3. Below the topology is the command output for ‘ipconfig’ with the IP address highlighted.</div>
