        <h1>Interpreting Trace Messages</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A trace returns a list of hops as a packet is routed through a network. The form of the command depends on where the command is issued. When performing the trace from a Windows computer, use <b>tracert</b>. When performing the trace from a router CLI, use <b>traceroute</b>, as shown in Figure 1.</p>
          <p>Figure 2 shows example output of the <b>tracert</b> command entered on Host 1 to trace the route to Host 2. The only successful response was from the gateway on Router A. Trace requests to the next hop timed out, meaning that the next hop router did not respond. The trace results indicate that there is either a failure in the internetwork beyond the LAN, or that these routers have been configured to not respond to echo requests used in the trace.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows four routers connected one after the other via WAN links. Router A and Router D each have a switch and two PCs connected. Router A is entering the “traceroute 10.1.0.2” command to trace the route to Host 2 connected to Router D. Host 1 is entering the “tracert 10.1.0.2” command to also trace the same route. Figure 2 shows the command output for Host 1’s command. The trace failed after Router A.</div>
