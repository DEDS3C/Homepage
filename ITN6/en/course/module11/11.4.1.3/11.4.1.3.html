        <h1>Verify and Monitor Solution</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Cisco IOS includes powerful tools to with help troubleshooting and verification. When a problem has been solved and a solution implemented, it is important to verify the system operation. Verification tools include the <b>ping</b>, <b>traceroute</b> and <b>show</b> commands. The <b>ping</b> command can be used to verify successful network connectivity.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If a <b>ping</b> is successful, as shown in Figure 1, it is safe to conclude packets are being routed from source to destination.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: A failed <b>ping</b> usually does not provide enough information to draw any conclusions. It could be the result of an ACL or firewall blocking ICMP packets, or the destination device may be configured to not respond to pings. A failed ping is usually indication that further investigation is required.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The <b>traceroute</b> command, as shown in Figure 2 2, is useful for displaying the path that packets are using to reach a destination. While output from the <b>ping</b> command shows whether a packet has arrived at the destination, output from the <b>traceroute</b> command shows what path it took to get there, or where the packet was stopped along the path.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Cisco IOS <b>show</b> commands are some of the most useful troubleshooting and verification tools included the Cisco IOS. Taking advantage of a large variety of options and sub-options, the <b>show</b> command can be used to narrow down and display information about practically any specific aspect of IOS.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 3 displays the output of a <b>show ip interface brief</b> command. Notice that the two interfaces configured with IPv4 addresses are both “up” and “up”. These interfaces can send and receive traffic. The other three interfaces have no IPv4 addressing and are administratively down.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1, 2, and 3 show a topology with a PC, a switch, and three routers. The PC is connected to the switch, which is connected to router R1, which is connected to router R2, which is connected to router R3. Figure 1 shows ping command output. Figure 2 shows traceroute output. Figure 3 shows output for the ‘show ip interface brief’ command.</div>
