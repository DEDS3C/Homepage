          <p>Keeping up-to-date with the latest developments can lead to a more effective defense against network attacks. As new malware is released, enterprises need to keep current with the latest versions of antivirus software.</p>
          <p>The most effective way to mitigate a worm attack is to download security updates from the operating system vendor and patch all vulnerable systems. Administering numerous systems involves the creation of a standard software image (operating system and accredited applications that are authorized for use on client systems) that is deployed on new or upgraded systems. However, security requirements change and already deployed systems may need to have updated security patches installed.</p>
          <p>One solution to the management of critical security patches is to create a central patch server that all systems must communicate with after a set period of time, as shown in the figure. Any patches that are not applied to a host are automatically downloaded from the patch server and installed without user intervention. </p>
