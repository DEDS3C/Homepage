        <h1>Access Attacks</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Access attacks exploit known vulnerabilities in authentication services, FTP services, and web services to gain entry to web accounts, confidential databases, and other sensitive information. An access attack allows an individual to gain unauthorized access to information that they have no right to view. Access attacks can be classified into four types: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Password attacks (Figure 1)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Trust Exploitation (Figure 2)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Port Redirection (Figure 3)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Man-in-the-Middle (Figure 4)</li>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 is an example of a password attack.  The user authentication dialog box is shown. Figure 2 is a video showing how a trust exploitation works.  An attacker on a host cannot get access to system A, but can get access to system B.  Since system B can access system A, the attacker can now access system A. Figure 3 shows a complex network.  There is an attacker on a host.  The attacker cannot access a device on the inside of a firewall.  However, the attacker can access a host that can access devices inside the firewall.  This is a form of a trust exploitation using port redirection.  Now packets can be forwarded to the trusted host to be redirected into the network. Figure 4 is an example of a man in the middle attack.  There is a laptop connected to a switch. The switch connects to a router and then to the Internet.  The attacker convinces the laptop to forward all traffic to his computer.  The attacker forwards the traffic correctly and returns it to the laptop. However, as a result, the attacker can inspect all packets to and from the laptop.</div>
