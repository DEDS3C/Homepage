        <h1>Default Gateway Issues</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The default gateway for an end device is the closest networking device that can forward traffic to other networks. If a device has an incorrect or nonexistent default gateway address, it will not be able to communicate with devices in remote networks. Because the default gateway is the path to remote networks, its address must belong to the same network as the end device.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The address of the default gateway can be manually set or obtained from a DHCP server. Similar to IPv4 addressing issues, default gateway problems can be related to misconfiguration (in the case of manual assignment) or DHCP problems (if automatic assignment is in use).</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To solve misconfigured default gateway issues, ensure that the device has the correct default gateway configured. If the default address was manually set but is incorrect, simply replace it with the proper address. If the default gateway address was automatically set, ensure the device can properly communicate with the DHCP server. It is also important to verify that the proper IPv4 address and subnet mask were configured on the router’s interface and that the interface is active.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To verify the default gateway on Windows-based computers, use the <b>ipconfig</b> command, as shown in Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>On a router, use the <b>show ip route</b> command to list the routing table and verify that the default gateway, known as a default route, has been set. This route is used when the destination address of the packet does not match any other routes in its routing table. Figure 2 shows that R2 is the default route for R1 and the output of the <b>show ip route </b>command shows that the default gateway has been set with a default route of 10.1.0.2.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows a topology with a PC, a switch, and three routers. The PC is connected to the switch, which is connected to router R1, which is connected to router R2, which is connected to router R3. Below the topology is the command output for ‘ipconfig’ with the default gateway highlighted.</div>
