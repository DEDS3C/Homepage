        <h1>TCP Connection Establishment</h1>
        <div>
          <p>In some cultures, when two persons meet, they often greet each other by shaking hands. The act of shaking hands is understood by both parties as a signal for a friendly greeting. Connections on the network are similar. In TCP connections, the host client establishes the connection with the server. </p>
          <p>A TCP connection is established in three steps:</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1</b> - The initiating client requests a client-to-server communication session with the server.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2</b> - The server acknowledges the client-to-server communication session and requests a server-to-client communication session. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3</b> - The initiating client acknowledges the server-to-client communication session.</p>
          <p>In the figure, click buttons 1 through 3 to see the TCP connection establishment.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows the steps involved in the three-way handshake during a TCP connection establishment.  Step one shows the initiating client forming a SYN packet with a sequence number of 100 and sends the SYN request to client B.  Step two shows client B receiving the SYN and setting the sequence number to 300 and sending the SYN along with an ACK packet back to client A.  Step three shows client A receiving the SYN and ACK sent by client B, this establishes the connection.</div>
