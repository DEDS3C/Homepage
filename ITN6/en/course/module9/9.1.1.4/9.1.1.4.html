        <h1>Transport Layer Reliability</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The transport layer is also responsible for managing reliability requirements of a conversation. Different applications have different transport reliability requirements. </p>
          <p>IP is concerned only with the structure, addressing, and routing of packets. IP does not specify how the delivery or transportation of the packets takes place. Transport protocols specify how to transfer messages between hosts. TCP/IP provides two transport layer protocols, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP), as shown in the figure. IP uses these transport protocols to enable hosts to communicate and transfer data.</p>
          <p>TCP is considered a reliable, full-featured transport layer protocol, which ensures that all of the data arrives at the destination. However, this requires additional fields in the TCP header which increases the size of the packet and also increases delay. In contrast, UDP is a simpler transport layer protocol that does not provide for reliability. It therefore has fewer fields and is faster than TCP.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure shows the four layers of the TCP/IP model and lists protocols that work at each of the layers.  At the Application layer there is FTP, HTTP, SMTP, DNS, and TFTP.  At the Transport layer there is both TCP and UDP.  The Internet layer has IP and the Network Access layer has LAN and WAN connections.</div>
