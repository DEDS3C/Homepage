        <h1>UDP Datagram Reassembly</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Like segments with TCP, when UDP datagrams are sent to a destination, they often take different paths and arrive in the wrong order. UDP does not track sequence numbers the way TCP does. UDP has no way to reorder the datagrams into their transmission order, as shown in the figure. </p>
          <p>Therefore, UDP simply reassembles the data in the order that it was received and forwards it to the application. If the data sequence is important to the application, the application must identify the proper sequence and determine how the data should be processed.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows data being divided into six datagrams, which are then sent through a network of five routers that are connected with redundant links thereby allowing multiple paths for the datagrams to follow.  They do not arrive at the destination in same order they were sent.  Since these are datagrams utilizing UDP, any out of order datagrams delivered will not be reordered and any lost datagrams will not be re-sent.</div>
