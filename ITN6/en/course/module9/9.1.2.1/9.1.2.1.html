        <h1>TCP Features</h1>
        <div>
          <p>To understand the differences between TCP and UDP, it is important to understand how each protocol implements specific reliability features and how they track conversations. In addition to supporting the basic functions of data segmentation and reassembly, TCP, as shown in the figure, also provides other services.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Establishing a Session</b>
          </p>
          <p>TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. A connection-oriented protocol is one that negotiates and establishes a permanent connection (or session) between source and destination devices prior to forwarding any traffic. Through session establishment, the devices negotiate the amount of traffic that can be forwarded at a given time, and the communication data between the two can be closely managed. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Reliable Delivery</b>
          </p>
          <p>In networking terms, reliability means ensuring that each segment that the source sends arrives at the destination. For many reasons, it is possible for a segment to become corrupted or lost completely, as it is transmitted over the network. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Same-Order Delivery</b>
          </p>
          <p>Because networks may provide multiple routes that can have different transmission rates, data can arrive in the wrong order. By numbering and sequencing the segments, TCP can ensure that these segments are reassembled into the proper order. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Flow Control</b>
          </p>
          <p>Network hosts have limited resources, such as memory and processing power. When TCP is aware that these resources are overtaxed, it can request that the sending application reduce the rate of data flow. This is done by TCP regulating the amount of data the source transmits. Flow control can prevent the need for retransmission of the data when the receiving host's resourses are overwhelmed. </p>
