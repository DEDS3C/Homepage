        <h1>UDP Low Overhead versus Reliability</h1>
        <div>
          <p>UDP is a simple protocol that provides the basic transport layer functions. It has much lower overhead than TCP because it is not connection-oriented and does not offer the sophisticated retransmission, sequencing, and flow control mechanisms that provide reliability.</p>
          <p>This does not mean that applications that use UDP are always unreliable, nor does it mean that UDP is an inferior protocol. It simply means that these functions are not provided by the transport layer protocol and must be implemented elsewhere if required.</p>
          <p>The low overhead of UDP makes it very desirable for protocols that make simple request and reply transactions. For example, using TCP for DHCP would introduce unnecessary network traffic. If there is a problem with a request or a reply, the device simply sends the request again if no response is received.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows two network segments connected through a network.  In one network segment there is a computer sending data, an I.P. phone, and a computer using a video application.  On the other segment there is a computer receiving the data sent by the sending computer, an IP phone, and a computer using a video application.  These are two examples of applications that utilize UDP due to its low overhead data transport method.  UDP provides this low overhead data transport because it has a small datagram header and no network management traffic.</div>
