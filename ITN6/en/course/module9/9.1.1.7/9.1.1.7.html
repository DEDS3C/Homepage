        <h1>The Right Transport Layer Protocol for the Right Application</h1>
        <div>
          <p>For some applications, segments must arrive in a very specific sequence to be processed successfully. With other applications, all data must be fully received before any is considered useful. In both of these instances, TCP is used as the transport protocol. Application developers must choose which transport protocol type is appropriate based on the requirements of the applications. </p>
          <p>For example, applications such as databases, web browsers, and email clients, require that all data that is sent arrives at the destination in its original condition. Any missing data could cause a corrupt communication that is either incomplete or unreadable. These applications are designed to use TCP. </p>
          <p>In other cases, an application can tolerate some data loss during transmission over the network, but delays in transmission are unacceptable. UDP is the better choice for these applications because less network overhead is required. UDP is preferable for applications such as streaming live audio, live video, and Voice over IP (VoIP). Acknowledgments and retransmission would slow down delivery. </p>
          <p>For example, if one or two segments of a live video stream fail to arrive, it creates a momentary disruption in the stream. This may appear as distortion in the image or sound, but may not be noticeable to the user. If the destination device had to account for lost data, the stream could be delayed while waiting for retransmissions, therefore causing the image or sound to be greatly degraded. In this case, it is better to render the best media possible with the segments received, and forego reliability.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Applications that stream stored audio and video use TCP. For example, if your network suddenly cannot support the bandwidth needed to watch an on-demand movie, the application pauses the playback. During the pause, you might see a “buffering...” message while TCP works to re-establish the stream. Once all the segments are in order and a minimum level of bandwidth is restored, your TCP session resumes and the movie begins playing. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows UDP protocol properties on the left including fast, low overhead, does not require acknowledgments, and delivers data as it arrives. On the right are the TCP properties including reliable, acknowledges data, resends lost data, and delivers data in order sent. Example UDP applications include IP telephony and streaming live video. Example TCP applications include Email and HTTP.</div>
