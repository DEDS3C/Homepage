        <h1>Socket Pairs</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The source and destination ports are placed within the segment. The segments are then encapsulated within an IP packet. The IP packet contains the IP address of the source and destination. The combination of the source IP address and source port number, or the destination IP address and destination port number is known as a socket. The socket is used to identify the server and service being requested by the client. A client socket might look like this, with 1099 representing the source port number: 192.168.1.5:1099 </p>
          <p>The socket on a web server might be: 192.168.1.7:80</p>
          <p>Together, these two sockets combine to form a socket pair: 192.168.1.5:1099, 192.168.1.7:80</p>
          <p>Sockets enable multiple processes, running on a client, to distinguish themselves from each other, and multiple connections to a server process to be distinguished from each other.</p>
          <p>The source port number acts as a return address for the requesting application. The transport layer keeps track of this port and the application that initiated the request so that when a response is returned, it can be forwarded to the correct application.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows the location of the source and destination port numbers within a segment.  The figure is showing a computer that has both an active FTP session and a web session.  When data is meant for the FTP server the computer selects a random source port value above 1023 and assigns 21 to the destination port.  In the figure the source port used is 1305.  The IP address and the port number create the socket and this allows the computer to keep track of the FTP data.  The web traffic also uses a random source port above 1023, and in the figure it is using port 1099.  The data destined for the web server is assigned a destination port of 80, which is the port used by web servers.  The IP address and the port number create the socket and this allows the computer to keep track of the web server connection.</div>
