        <h1>TCP Session Termination</h1>
        <div>
          <p>To close a connection, the Finish (FIN) control flag must be set in the segment header. To end each one-way TCP session, a two-way handshake, consisting of a FIN segment and an Acknowledgment (ACK) segment, is used. Therefore, to terminate a single conversation supported by TCP, four exchanges are needed to end both sessions.</p>
          <p>In the figure, click buttons 1 through 4 to see the TCP connection termination.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: In this explanation, the terms client and server are used as a reference for simplicity, but the termination process can be initiated by any two hosts that have an open session:</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1</b> - When the client has no more data to send in the stream, it sends a segment with the FIN flag set.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2</b> - The server sends an ACK to acknowledge the receipt of the FIN to terminate the session from client to server.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3</b> - The server sends a FIN to the client to terminate the server-to-client session.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 4</b> - The client responds with an ACK to acknowledge the FIN from the server.</p>
          <p>When all segments have been acknowledged, the session is closed.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows the four exchanges required to close a connection.  The first step shown is when client A is ready to close the connection therefore it sends a segment with the FIN flag set and it is received by client B.  Step two has client B sending an ACK to client A.  Step three is also from client B and it sends a FIN to client A to terminate the server to client session and the client receives the FIN.  The final step is when client A responds to client B by sending an ACK to client B.</div>
