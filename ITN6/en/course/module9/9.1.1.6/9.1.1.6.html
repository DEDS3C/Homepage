        <h1>UDP</h1>
        <div>
          <p>While the TCP reliability functions provide more robust communication between applications, they also incur additional overhead and possible delays in transmission. There is a trade-off between the value of reliability and the burden it places on network resources. Adding overhead to ensure reliability for some applications could reduce the usefulness of the application and can even be detrimental. In such cases, UDP is a better transport protocol. </p>
          <p>UDP provides the basic functions for delivering data segments between the appropriate applications, with very little overhead and data checking. UDP is known as a best-effort delivery protocol. In the context of networking, best-effort delivery is referred to as unreliable because there is no acknowledgment that the data is received at the destination. With UDP, there are no transport layer processes that inform the sender of a successful delivery.</p>
          <p>UDP is similar to placing a regular, non-registered, letter in the mail. The sender of the letter is not aware of the availability of the receiver to receive the letter. Nor is the post office responsible for tracking the letter or informing the sender if the letter does not arrive at the final destination. </p>
          <p>Click Play in the figure to see an animation of UDP segments being transmitted from sender to receiver. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure is an animation that shows a computer sending a file to a server using the TFTP application, which utilizes the UDP at the transport layer.  The data is segmented into six segments and all packets leave the computer and are sent to a router and then directed to the TFTP server on a remote server farm network.  The server receives all the packets, but since it is using UDP no acknowledgment packet is sent from the server.</div>
