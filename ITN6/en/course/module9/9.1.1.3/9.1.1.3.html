        <h1>Conversation Multiplexing</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Sending some types of data (for example, a streaming video) across a network, as one complete communication stream, can consume all of the available bandwidth. This will then prevent other communications from occurring at the same time. It would also make error recovery and retransmission of damaged data difficult. </p>
          <p>The figure shows that segmenting the data into smaller chunks enables many different communications, from many different users, to be interleaved (multiplexed) on the same network. </p>
          <p>To identify each segment of data, the transport layer adds a header containing binary data organized into several fields. It is the values in these fields that enable various transport layer protocols to perform different functions in managing data communication.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure shows a single computer that has multiple web pages open along with an instant messaging window, an e-mail application, a streaming video application and a VoIP phone application running.  There is a series of data blocks of varying colors that represent the various applications running on the computer.  The series of blocks are created by the transport layer breaking the data into segments, and each block is a segment.  This is multiplexing where multiple applications can use the network at the same time.  Each data block can have error checking performed on it to check if the segment was changed during transmission.</div>
