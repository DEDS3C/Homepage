        <h1>UDP Client Processes</h1>
        <div>
          <p>As with TCP, client-server communication is initiated by a client application that requests data from a server process. The UDP client process dynamically selects a port number from the range of port numbers and uses this as the source port for the conversation. The destination port is usually the well-known or registered port number assigned to the server process. </p>
          <p>After a client has selected the source and destination ports, the same pair of ports is used in the header of all datagrams used in the transaction. For the data returning to the client from the server, the source and destination port numbers in the datagram header are reversed.</p>
          <p>Click through Figures 1 through 5 to see details of the UDP client processes.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows a server running a DNS server on port 53 and a RADIUS server on port 1812.  The figure has two clients accessing the server.  Client 1 is sending a DNS request from source port 49152 to destination port 53.  Client 2 is sending a RADIUS request from source port 51152 to destination port 1812.  This demonstrates how port numbers are used to differentiate between multiple services running on one server. Figure 2 highlights the use of the well-known ports for the services. Figure 3 highlights the use of random port numbers as the source ports. Figure 4 highlights the response from the server to each of the two requests and the fact that the server uses the source port from the request packet as the destination. Figure 5 highlights the new destination port.</div>
