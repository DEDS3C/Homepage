          <p>Although requiring passwords is one way to keep unauthorized personnel out of a network, it is vital to provide a method for declaring that only authorized personnel should attempt to gain entry into the device. To do this, add a banner to the device output. Banners can be an important part of the legal process in the event that someone is prosecuted for breaking into a device. Some legal systems do not allow prosecution, or even the monitoring of users, unless a notification is visible. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To create a banner message of the day on a network device, use the <b>banner motd # </b><i>the message of the day</i><b> # </b>global config command. The “#” in the command syntax is called the delimiting character. It is entered before and after the message. The delimiting character can be any character as long as it does not occur in the message. For this reason, symbols such as the "#" are often used. After the command is executed, the banner will be displayed on all subsequent attempts to access the device until the banner is removed.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Because banners can be seen by anyone who attempts to log in, the message must be worded very carefully. The exact content or wording of a banner depends on the local laws and corporate policies. The banner should state that only authorized personnel are allowed to access the device. Any wording that implies a login is "welcome" or "invited" is inappropriate. Further, the banner can include scheduled system shutdowns and other information that affects all network users.</p>
