        <h1>Secure Device Access</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The use of weak or easily guessed passwords continues to be a security issue in many facets of the business world. Network devices, including home wireless routers, should always have passwords configured to limit administrative access. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Cisco IOS can be configured to use hierarchical mode passwords to allow different access privileges to a network device. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>All networking devices should limit access as listed in Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use strong passwords that are not easily guessed. Consider the key points listed in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Most of the labs in this course use simple passwords such as<b> cisco</b> or <b>class</b>. These passwords are considered weak and easily guessable and should be avoided in production environments. We only use these passwords for convenience in a classroom setting or to illustrate configuration examples.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 lists the tasks to limit device access inclucing: secure privileged EXEC access with a password; secure user EXEC access with a password; and secure remote Telnet access with a password. Other tasks include: encrypt all passwords and provide legal notification. Figure 2 list guidelines you should use when choosing a password: use passwords that are more than 8 characters in length; use a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and/or numeric sequences; avoid using the same password for all devices; donâ€™t use common words because these are easily guessed.</div>
