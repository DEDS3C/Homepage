        <h1>Device Names</h1>
        <div>
          <p>When configuring a networking device, one of the first steps is configuring a unique device name or hostname. Hostnames that appear in CLI prompts can be used in various authentication processes between devices, and should be used on topology diagrams.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If the device name is not explicitly configured, a factory assigned default name is used by the Cisco IOS. The default name for a Cisco IOS switch is "Switch." If all network devices were left with their default names, it would be difficult to identify a specific device. For instance, when accessing a remote device using SSH, it is important to have confirmation that you are connected to the proper device.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>By choosing names wisely, it is easier to remember, document, and identify network devices. Guidelines for hostname configuration are listed in Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The hostnames used in the device IOS preserve capitalization and lowercase characters. Therefore, it allows you to capitalize a name as you ordinarily would. This contrasts with most Internet naming schemes, where uppercase and lowercase characters are treated identically. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For example, in Figure 2, three switches, spanning three different floors, are interconnected together in a network. The naming convention used took into consideration the location and the purpose of each device. Network documentation should explain how these names were chosen so additional devices can be named accordingly.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows the guidelines for choosing a hostname. Hostnames should: start with a letter; contain no spaces; end with a letter or digit; use only letters, digits, and dashes; and be less than 64 characters in length. Figure 2 a technician connected to a switch that is part of a network of three switches. Each switch is named with a descriptive name so it is easy to know which device you are configuring.</div>
