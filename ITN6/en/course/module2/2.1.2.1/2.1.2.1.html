        <h1>Access Methods</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A Cisco IOS switch can be implemented with no configuration and still switch data between connected devices. By connecting two PCs to a switch, those PCs will instantly have connectivity with one another. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Even though a Cisco switch will function immediately, configuring initial settings are a recommended best practice. There are several ways to access the CLI environment and configure the device. The most common methods are:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Console</b> – This is a physical management port that provides out-of-band access to a Cisco device. Out-of-band access refers to access via a dedicated management channel that is used for device maintenance purposes only.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Secure Shell (SSH)</b> – SSH is a method for remotely establishing a secure CLI connection through a virtual interface, over a network. Unlike a console connection, SSH connections require active networking services on the device including an active interface configured with an address. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Telnet</b> - Telnet is an insecure method of remotely establishing a CLI session through a virtual interface, over a network. Unlike SSH, Telnet does not provide a securely encrypted connection. User authentication, passwords, and commands are sent over the network in plaintext. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>

          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note:</b> Some devices, such as routers, may also support a legacy auxiliary port that was used to establish a CLI session remotely using a modem. Similar to a console connection, the AUX port is out-of-band and does not require networking services to be configured or available.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure includes more text for console, SSH, and Telnet access methods. The advantage of using a console port is that the device is accessible even if no networking services have been configured, such as when performing an initial configuration of the networking device. When performing an initial configuration, a computer running terminal emulation software is connected to the console port of the device using a special cable. Configuration commands for setting up the switch or router can be entered on the connected computer. SSH is the recommended method for remote management because it provides a secure connection. SSH provides encrypted password authentication and transport of session data. This keeps the user ID, password, and the details of the management session private. Most versions of Cisco IOS include an SSH server and an SSH client that can be used to establish SSH sessions with other devices. Best practice dictates to use SSH instead of Telnet for remote management CLI connections. Cisco IOS includes a Telnet server and a Telnet client that can be used to establish Telnet sessions with other devices.</div>
