        <h1>Capture Configuration to a Text File</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Configuration files can also be saved and archived to a text document. This sequence of steps ensures that a working copy of the configuration file is available for editing or reuse later.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For example, assume that a switch has been configured, and the running configuration has been saved on the device.</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Open a terminal emulation software such as PuTTY or Tera Term (Figure 1) connected to a switch.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Enable logging in the terminal software, such as PuTTY or Tera Term, and assign a name and file location to save the log file. Figure 2 displays that <b>All session output</b> will be captured to the file specified (i.e., MySwitchLogs).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Execute the <b>show running-config</b> or <b>show startup-config</b> command at the privileged EXEC prompt. Text displayed in the terminal window will be placed into the chosen file.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Disable logging in the terminal software. Figure 3 shows how to disable logging by choosing the <b>None</b> session logging option.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The text file created can be used as a record of how the device is currently implemented. The file could require editing before being used to restore a saved configuration to a device.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To restore a configuration file to a device:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Enter global configuration mode on the device.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Copy and paste the text file into the terminal window connected to the switch. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The text in the file will be applied as commands in the CLI and become the running configuration on the device. This is a convenient method of manually configuring a device.</p>
