            <b>Students will work in pairs. Packet Tracer is required for this activity.</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Assume that a new colleague has asked you for an orientation to the Cisco IOS CLI. This colleague has never worked with Cisco devices before. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>You explain the basic CLI commands and structure because you want your colleague to understand that the CLI is a simple, yet powerful, command language that can be easily understood and navigated.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Use Packet Tracer and one of the activities available in this chapter as a simple network model (for example, Lab - Configuring a Switch Management Address). </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Focus on these areas:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>While the commands are technical, do they resemble any statements from plain English?</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>How is the set of commands organized into subgroups or modes? How does an administrator know which mode he or she is currently using?</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>What are the individual commands to configure the basic settings of a Cisco device? How would you explain this command in simple terms? Use parallels to real life whenever appropriate.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Suggest how to group different commands together according to their modes so that a minimum number of moves between modes will be needed.</p>
          <p></p>
