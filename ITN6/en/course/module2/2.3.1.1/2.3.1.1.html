        <h1>IP Addresses</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The use of IP addresses is the primary means of enabling devices to locate one another and establish end-to-end communication on the Internet. Each end device on a network must be configured with an IP address. Examples of end devices are listed in Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The structure of an IPv4 address is called dotted decimal notation and is represented by four decimal numbers between 0 and 255. IPv4 addresses are assigned to individual devices connected to a network. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: IP in this course refers to both the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. IPv6 is the most recent version of IP and the replacement for the more common IPv4.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>With the IPv4 address, a subnet mask is also necessary. An IPv4 subnet mask is a 32-bit value that separates the network portion of the address from the host portion. Coupled with the IPv4 address, the subnet mask determines which particular subnet the device is a member. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The example in Figure 2 displays the IPv4 address (192.168.1.10), subnet mask (255.255.255.0), and default gateway (192.168.1.1) assigned to a host. The default gateway address is the IP address of the router that the host will use to access remote networks, including the Internet. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>IP addresses can be assigned to both physical ports and virtual interfaces on devices. A virtual interface means that there is no physical hardware on the device associated with it.</p>

Figure 2 shows the Windows TCP/IPv4 Properties window with IP address information statically configured.</div>
