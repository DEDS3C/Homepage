        <h1>Common P2P Applications</h1>
        <div>
          <p>With P2P applications, each computer in the network running the application can act as a client or a server for the other computers in the network running the application. Common P2P networks include:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>eDonkey</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>G2</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>BitTorrent</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Bitcoin</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Some P2P applications are based on the Gnutella protocol, where each user shares whole files with other users. As shown in the figure, Gnutella-compatible client software allows users to connect to Gnutella services over the Internet and to locate and access resources shared by other Gnutella peers. Many Gnutella client applications are available, including gtk-gnutella, WireShare, Shareaza, and Bearshare. </p>
          <p>Many P2P applications allow users to share pieces of many files with each other at the same time. Clients use a small file called a torrent file to locate other users who have pieces that they need so that they can connect directly to them. This file also contains information about tracker computers that keep track of which users have what files. Clients ask for pieces from multiple users at the same time, known as a swarm. This technology is called BitTorrent. There are many BitTorrent clients including BitTorrent, uTorrent, Frostwire, and qBittorrent.</p>
