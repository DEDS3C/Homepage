        <h1>Peer-to-Peer Networks</h1>
        <div>
          <p>In the peer-to-peer (P2P) networking model, the data is accessed from a peer device without the use of a dedicated server.</p>
          <p>The P2P network model involves two parts: P2P networks and P2P applications. Both parts have similar features, but in practice work quite differently.</p>
          <p>In a P2P network, two or more computers are connected via a network and can share resources (such as printers and files) without having a dedicated server. Every connected end device (known as a peer) can function as both a server and a client. One computer might assume the role of server for one transaction while simultaneously serving as a client for another. The roles of client and server are set on a per request basis.</p>
          <p>A simple example of P2P networking is shown in the figure. In addition to sharing files, a network such as this one would allow users to enable networked games, or share an Internet connection.</p>
