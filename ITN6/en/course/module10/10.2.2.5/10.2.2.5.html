        <h1>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for IPv4 service automates the assignment of IPv4 addresses, subnet masks, gateways, and other IPv4 networking parameters. This is referred to as dynamic addressing. The alternative to dynamic addressing is static addressing. When using static addressing, the network administrator manually enters IP address information on hosts.</p>
          <p>When a host connects to the network, the DHCP server is contacted, and an address is requested. The DHCP server chooses an address from a configured range of addresses called a pool and assigns (leases) it to the host.</p>
          <p>On larger networks, or where the user population changes frequently, DHCP is preferred for address assignment. New users may arrive and need connections; others may have new computers that must be connected. Rather than use static addressing for each connection, it is more efficient to have IPv4 addresses assigned automatically using DHCP.</p>
          <p>DHCP-distributed addresses are leased for a set period of time. When the lease is expired, the address is returned to the pool for reuse if the host has been powered down or taken off the network. Users can freely move from location to location and easily re-establish network connections through DHCP. </p>
          <p>As the figure shows, various types of devices can be DHCP servers. The DHCP server in most medium-to-large networks is usually a local, dedicated PC-based server. With home networks, the DHCP server is usually located on the local router that connects the home network to the ISP. </p>
          <p>Many networks use both DHCP and static addressing. DHCP is used for general purpose hosts, such as end user devices. Static addressing is used for network devices, such as gateways, switches, servers, and printers.</p>
          <p>DHCPv6 (DHCP for IPv6) provides similar services for IPv6 clients. One important difference is that DHCPv6 does not provide a default gateway address. This can only be obtained dynamically from the router's Router Advertisement message.</p>
