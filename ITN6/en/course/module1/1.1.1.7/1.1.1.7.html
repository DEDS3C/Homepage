        <h1>Networks Support the Way We Play</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The Internet is used for traditional forms of entertainment. We listen to recording artists, preview or view motion pictures, read entire books, and download material for future offline access. Live sporting events and concerts can be experienced as they are happening, or recorded and viewed on demand.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Networks enable the creation of new forms of entertainment, such as online games. Players participate in any kind of online competition that game designers can imagine. We compete with friends and foes around the world as if we were all in the same room.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Even offline activities are enhanced using network collaboration services. Global communities of interest have grown rapidly. We share common experiences and hobbies well beyond our local neighborhood, city, or region. Sports fans share opinions and facts about their favorite teams. Collectors display prized collections and get expert feedback about them. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Whatever form of recreation we enjoy, networks are improving our experience.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>How do you play on the Internet?</p>
