        <h1>Networks Support the Way We Work</h1>
        <div>
          <p>In the business world, data networks were initially used by businesses to internally record and manage financial information, customer information, and employee payroll systems. These business networks evolved to enable the transmission of many different types of information services, including email, video, messaging, and telephony.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The use of networks to provide efficient and cost-effective employee training is increasing in acceptance. Online learning opportunities can decrease time-consuming and costly travel, yet still ensure that all employees are adequately trained to perform their jobs in a safe and productive manner.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are many success stories illustrating innovative ways networks are being used to make us more successful in the workplace. Some of these scenarios are available through the Cisco web site at <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/about/success-stories/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.cisco.com/web/about/success-stories/index.html</a>.</p>
