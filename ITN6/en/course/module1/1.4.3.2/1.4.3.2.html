        <h1>Security Solutions</h1>
        <div>
          <p>No single solution can protect the network from the variety of threats that exist. For this reason, security should be implemented in multiple layers, using more than one security solution. If one security component fails to identify and protect the network, others still stand. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A home network security implementation is usually rather basic. It is generally implemented on the connecting end devices, as well as at the point of connection to the Internet, and can even rely on contracted services from the ISP. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In contrast, the network security implementation for a corporate network usually consists of many components built into the network to monitor and filter traffic. Ideally, all components work together, which minimizes maintenance and improves security.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Network security components for a home or small office network should include, at a minimum:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Antivirus and antispyware</b> – These are used to protect end devices from becoming infected with malicious software.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Firewall filtering </b>– This is used to block unauthorized access to the network. This may include a host-based firewall system that is implemented to prevent unauthorized access to the end device, or a basic filtering service on the home router to prevent unauthorized access from the outside world into the network.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In addition to the above, larger networks and corporate networks often have other security requirements:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Dedicated firewall systems</b> – These are used to provide more advanced firewall capabilities that can filter large amounts of traffic with more granularity.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Access control lists (ACL)</b> – These are used to further filter access and traffic forwarding.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Intrusion prevention systems (IPS)</b> – These are used to identify fast-spreading threats, such as zero-day or zero-hour attacks. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Virtual private networks (VPN)</b> – These are used to provide secure access to remote workers.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Network security requirements must take into account the network environment, as well as the various applications, and computing requirements. Both home environments and businesses must be able to secure their data while still allowing for the quality of service that is expected of each technology. Additionally, the security solution implemented must be adaptable to the growing and changing trends of the network. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The study of network security threats and mitigation techniques starts with a clear understanding of the underlying switching and routing infrastructure used to organize network services.</p>
