        <h1>CCENT and CCNA Certification</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The role and skills required of network engineers are evolving and are more vital than ever. The Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) Routing and Switching certification demonstrates you have a knowledge of foundational technologies and ensures you stay relevant with skill sets needed for the adoption of next generation technologies.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The CCNA Routing and Switching certification is achieved by passing two exams or one composite exam. A candidate who passes the first exam is qualified to be called a Cisco Certified Entry Network Technician (CCENT). The CCENT exam tests a candidate's knowledge and skills related to network fundamentals, LAN switching technologies, routing technologies, infrastructure services, and infrastructure maintenance. The second CCNA exam tests a candidate's knowledge and skills related to IPv4 and IPv6 routing technologies and WAN technologies, as well as more advanced technologies in LAN switching, infrastructure services, and infrastructure maintenance.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>This course helps set the stage for networking concepts and basic routing and switching configurations and is a start on your path towards CCENT and CCNA certification.</p>
