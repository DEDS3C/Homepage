        <h1>Businesses Internet Connections</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Corporate connection options differ from home user options. Businesses may require higher bandwidth, dedicated bandwidth, and managed services. Connection options available differ depending on the type of service providers located nearby. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The figure illustrates common connection options for businesses:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Dedicated Leased Line </b>- Leased lines are actually reserved circuits within the service providerâ€™s network that connect geographically separated offices for private voice and/or data networking. The circuits are typically rented at a monthly or yearly rate. They can be expensive. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Ethernet WAN </b>- Ethernet WANs extend LAN access technology into the WAN. Ethernet is a LAN technology you will learn about in a later chapter. The benefits of Ethernet are now being extended into the WAN. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>DSL </b>- Business DSL is available in various formats. A popular choice is Symmetric Digital Subscriber Lines (SDSL) which is similar to the consumer version of DSL, but provides  uploads and downloads at the same speeds.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Satellite </b>- Similar to small office and home office users, satellite service can provide a connection when a wired solution is not available. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The choice of connection varies depending on geographical location and service provider availability.</p>
