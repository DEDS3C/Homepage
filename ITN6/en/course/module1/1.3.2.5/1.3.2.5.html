        <h1>Security</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The network infrastructure, services, and the data contained on network-attached devices are crucial personal and business assets. There are two types of network security concerns that must be addressed: network infrastructure security and information security.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Securing a network infrastructure includes the physical securing of devices that provide network connectivity, and preventing unauthorized access to the management software that resides on them, as shown in Figure 1.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Information security refers to protecting the information contained within the packets being transmitted over the network and the information stored on network attached devices. In order to achieve the goals of network security, there are three primary requirements, as shown in Figure 2:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Confidentiality </b>- Data confidentiality means that only the intended and authorized recipients can access and read data. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Integrity</b> - Data integrity means having the assurance that the information has not been altered in transmission, from origin to destination. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Availability </b>- Data availability means having the assurance of timely and reliable access to data services for authorized users. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows a router requiring a user name and a password to access it, thereby giving security to the device.  Devices such as routers can also be secured from physical access by locking the room where they are stored. Figure 2 shows a triangle labeled on each side with one of the three primary security requirements: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.</div>
