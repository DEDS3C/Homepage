        <h1>Properties of Wireless Media</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Wireless media carry electromagnetic signals that represent the binary digits of data communications using radio or microwave frequencies. </p>
          <p>Wireless media provides the greatest mobility options of all media, and the number of wireless-enabled devices continues to increase. As network bandwidth options increase, wireless is quickly gaining in popularity in enterprise networks. </p>
          <p>The figure highlights various wireless-related symbols.</p>
          <p>Wireless does have some areas of concern, including:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Coverage area</b>: Wireless data communication technologies work well in open environments. However, certain construction materials used in buildings and structures, and the local terrain, will limit the effective coverage. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Interference: </b>Wireless is susceptible to interference and can be disrupted by such common devices as household cordless phones, some types of fluorescent lights, microwave ovens, and other wireless communications.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Security: </b>Wireless communication coverage requires no access to a physical strand of media. Therefore, devices and users, not authorized for access to the network, can gain access to the transmission. Network security is a major component of wireless network administration.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Shared medium: </b>WLANs operate in half-duplex, which means only one device can send or receive at a time. The wireless medium is shared amongst all wireless users. The more users needing to access the WLAN simultaneously, results in less bandwidth for each user. Half-duplex is discussed later in this chapter.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Although wireless is increasing in popularity for desktop connectivity, copper and fiber are the most popular physical layer media for network deployments.</p>
