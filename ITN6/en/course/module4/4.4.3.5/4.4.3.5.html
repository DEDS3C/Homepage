        <h1>Contention-Based Access – CSMA/CA</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Another form of CSMA that is used by IEEE 802.11 WLANs is Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA). CMSA/CA uses a method similar to CSMA/CD to detect if the media is clear. CMSA/CA also uses additional techniques. CMSA/CA does not detect collisions but attempts to avoid them by waiting before transmitting. Each device that transmits includes the time duration that it needs for the transmission. All other wireless devices receive this information and know how long the medium will be unavailable, as shown in the figure. After a wireless device sends an 802.11 frame, the receiver returns an acknowledgment so that the sender knows the frame arrived. </p>
          <p>Whether it is an Ethernet LAN using hubs, or a WLAN, contention-based systems do not scale well under heavy media use. It is important to note that Ethernet LANs using switches do not use a contention-based system because the switch and the host NIC operate in full-duplex mode.</p>

One laptop says “I’m receiving this wireless frame.” The other two laptops say “I see in the wireless frame that the channel is going to be unavailable for a specific amount of time so I can not send.”</div>
