        <h1>Half and Full Duplex</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Duplex communications refer to the direction of data transmission between two devices. Half-duplex communications restrict the exchange of data to one direction at a time while full-duplex allows the sending and receiving of data to happen simultaneously.</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Half-duplex communication</b> - Both devices can transmit and receive on the media but cannot do so simultaneously. The half-duplex mode is used in legacy bus topologies and with Ethernet hubs. WLANs also operate in half-duplex. Half-duplex allows only one device to send or receive at a time on the shared medium and is used with contention-based access methods. Figure 1 shows half-duplex communication.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Full-duplex communication</b> - Both devices can transmit and receive on the media at the same time. The data link layer assumes that the media is available for transmission for both nodes at any time. Ethernet switches operate in full-duplex mode by default, but can operate in half-duplex if connecting to a device such as an Ethernet hub. Figure 2 shows full-duplex communication.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>It is important that two interconnected interfaces, such as a hostâ€™s NIC and an interface on an Ethernet switch operate using the same duplex mode. Otherwise, there will be a duplex mismatch creating inefficiency and latency on the link. </p>
