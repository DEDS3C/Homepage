        <h1>Physical LAN Topologies</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Physical topology defines how the end systems are physically interconnected. In shared media LANs, end devices can be interconnected using the following physical topologies:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Star</b> - End devices are connected to a central intermediate device. Early star topologies interconnected end devices using Ethernet hubs. However, star topologies now use Ethernet switches. The star topology is easy to install, very scalable (easy to add and remove end devices), and easy to troubleshoot.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Extended Star</b> - In an extended star topology, additional Ethernet switches interconnect other star topologies. An extended star is an example of a hybrid topology.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Bus</b> - All end systems are chained to each other and terminated in some form on each end. Infrastructure devices such as switches are not required to interconnect the end devices. Bus topologies using coax cables were used in legacy Ethernet networks because it was inexpensive and easy to set up.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Ring</b> - End systems are connected to their respective neighbor forming a ring. Unlike the bus topology, the ring does not need to be terminated. Ring topologies were used in legacy Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) and Token Ring networks. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The figure illustrates how end devices are interconnected on LANs. It is common for a straight line in networking graphics to represent an Ethernet LAN including a simple star and an extended star.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows four physical topologies.  The star topology, the extended star topology, which looks like 2 start topologies connected, the bus topology, which is several computers connected to the same media and the ring topology, which is several computers connected to the same media that runs in a circle.</div>
