        <h1>Fiber versus Copper</h1>
        <div>
          <p>There are many advantages to using fiber-optic cable compared to copper cables. The figure highlights some of these differences.</p>
          <p>Given that the fibers used in fiber-optic media are not electrical conductors, the media is immune to electromagnetic interference and will not conduct unwanted electrical currents due to grounding issues. Optical fibers are thin and have a relatively low signal loss and can be operated at much greater lengths than copper media. Some optical fiber physical layer specifications allow lengths that can reach multiple kilometers.</p>
          <p>At present, in most enterprise environments, optical fiber is primarily used as backbone cabling for high-traffic point-to-point connections between data distribution facilities and for the interconnection of buildings in multi-building campuses. Because optical fiber does not conduct electricity and has a low signal loss, it is well suited for these uses.</p>
