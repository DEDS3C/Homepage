        <h1>Types of Connections</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Whether connecting to a local printer in the home or a web site in another country, before any network communications can occur, a physical connection to a local network must be established. A physical connection can be a wired connection using a cable or a wireless connection using radio waves. </p>
          <p>The type of physical connection used is dependent upon the setup of the network. For example, in many corporate offices employees have desktop or laptop computers that are physically connected, via cable, to a shared switch. This type of setup is a wired network. Data is transmitted through a physical cable.</p>
          <p>In addition to wired connections, many businesses also offer wireless connections for laptops, tablets, and smartphones. With wireless devices, data is transmitted using radio waves. The use of wireless connectivity is common as individuals, and businesses alike, discover the advantages of offering this type of service. To offer wireless capability, devices on a wireless network must be connected to a wireless access point (AP). </p>
          <p>Switch devices and wireless access points are often two separate dedicated devices within a network implementation. However, there are also devices that offer both wired and wireless connectivity. In many homes, for example, individuals are implementing home integrated service routers (ISRs), as shown in Figure 1. ISRs offer a switching component with multiple ports, allowing multiple devices to be connected to the local area network (LAN) using cables, as shown in Figure 2. Additionally, many ISRs also include an AP, which allows wireless devices to connect as well.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows the back of a home wireless router.  There are arrows pointing to four Ethernet ports (the LAN ports), one Ethernet port (Internet connection) and the top of the router (the built in wireless antenna). Figure two shows the wireless router and a laptop.  The laptop is connected to one of the four LAN ports.</div>
