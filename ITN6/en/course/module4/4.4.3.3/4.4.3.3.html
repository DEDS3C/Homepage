        <h1>Media Access Control Methods</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Some network topologies share a common medium with multiple nodes. These are called multi-access networks. Ethernet LANs and WLANs are examples of a multi-access network. At any one time, there may be a number of devices attempting to send and receive data using the same network media.</p>
          <p>Some multi-access networks require rules to govern how devices share the physical media. There are two basic access control methods for shared media: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Contention-based access</b> - All nodes operating in half-duplex compete for the use of the medium,  but only one device can send at a time. However, there is a process if more than one device transmits at the same time. Ethernet LANs using hubs and WLANs are examples of this type of access control.  Figure 1 shows contention-based access.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Controlled access</b> - Each node has its own time to use the medium.  These deterministic types of networks are inefficient because a device must wait its turn to access the medium. Legacy Token Ring LANs are an example of this type of access control. Figure 2 shows controlled access. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>By default, Ethernet switches operate in full-duplex mode. This allows the switch and the full-duplex connected device to send and receive simultaneously. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows three computers connected to the same media.  Each has a call out displaying "I try to send when I am ready". Figure 2 shows four computers connected to a ring topology. One says "My turn to send". All the others say â€œNot my turn yet".</div>
