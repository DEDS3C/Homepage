        <h1>Common Physical WAN Topologies</h1>
        <div>
          <p>WANs are commonly interconnected using the following physical topologies:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Point-to-Point -</b> This is the simplest topology that consists of a permanent link between two endpoints. For this reason, this is a very popular WAN topology.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Hub and Spoke</b> - A WAN version of the star topology in which a central site interconnects branch sites using point-to-point links. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Mesh</b> - This topology provides high availability, but requires that every end system be interconnected to every other system. Therefore, the administrative and physical costs can be significant. Each link is essentially a point-to-point link to the other node. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The three common physical WAN topologies are illustrated in the figure.</p>
          <p>A hybrid is a variation or combination of any of the above topologies. For example, a partial mesh is a hybrid topology in which some, but not all, end devices are interconnected.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows three diagrams of different types of wan topologies.  One for point to point, which is a simple connection between two routers, one for hub and spoke, which is a single router that has point to point connections to several other routers, and one for full mesh, which is several routers each connected with a point to point connection to several other routers.</div>
