        <h1>Types of Fiber Media</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Light pulses representing the transmitted data as bits on the media are generated by either:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Lasers</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Light emitting diodes (LEDs) </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Electronic semiconductor devices called photodiodes detect the light pulses and convert them to voltages. The laser light transmitted over fiber-optic cabling can damage the human eye. Care must be taken to avoid looking into the end of an active optical fiber.</p>
          <p>Fiber-optic cables are broadly classified into two types: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Single-mode fiber (SMF)</b>: Consists of a very small core and uses expensive laser technology to send a single ray of light, as shown in Figure 1. Popular in long-distance situations spanning hundreds of kilometers, such as those required in long haul telephony and cable TV applications. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Multimode fiber (MMF)</b>: Consists of a larger core and uses LED emitters to send light pulses. Specifically, light from an LED enters the multimode fiber at different angles, as shown in Figure 2. Popular in LANs because they can be powered by low-cost LEDs. It provides bandwidth up to 10 Gb/s over link lengths of up to 550 meters.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>One of the highlighted differences between multimode and single-mode fiber is the amount of dispersion. Dispersion refers to the spreading out of a light pulse over time. The more dispersion there is, the greater the loss of signal strength. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows a diagram of single mode fiber.  The core is 9 microns.  The cladding is 125 microns in diameter.  The laser creates a straight beam of light. Figure 2 shows a diagram of multi mode fiber.  The core is between 50 and 62.5 microns.  The cladding is 125 microns in diameter.  The LEDâ€™s make beams of light that reflect off the inside of the core.</div>
