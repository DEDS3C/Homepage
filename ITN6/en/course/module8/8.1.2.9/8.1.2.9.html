        <h1>Subnetting Formulas</h1>
        <div>
          <p>To calculate the number of subnets that can be created from the bits borrowed, use the formula displayed in Figure 1. Figure 2 displays the possible number of subnets that can be created when borrowing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 bits. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: The last two bits cannot be borrowed from the last octet because there would be no host addresses available. Therefore, the longest prefix length possible when subnetting is /30 or 255.255.255.252.</p>
          <p>To calculate the number of hosts that can be supported, use the formula displayed in Figure 3. There are two subnet addresses that cannot be assigned to a host, the network address and the broadcast address, so we must subtract 2.</p>
          <p>As shown in Figure 4, there are 7 host bits remaining, so the calculation is 2^7 = 128-2 = 126. This means that each of the subnets has 126 valid host addresses.</p>
          <p>Therefore, borrowing 1 host bit toward the network results in creating 2 subnets, and each subnet can have a total of 126 hosts assigned.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows the formula “2 to the power of n” where “n” is the number of bits borrowed. Figure 2 shows the formula calculation from 1 bit borrowed up to 6 bits borrowed. 2 to the 1 power equals 1, 2 to the 2 power equals four, and so on until 2 to the 6 power equals 64. Figure 3 shows the formula “2 to power of n minus 2” where “ne” is the number bits remaining in the host portion. Figure 4 shows the 192.168.1.0/25 subnet. The host bits are highlighted. The formula for the number of valid hosts per subnet is 2 to the 7 minus 2 which equals 126.</div>
