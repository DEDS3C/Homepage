        <h1>Classless Subnetting Example</h1>
        <div>
          <p>To understand how subnetting at a classless level can be useful, consider the following examples. </p>
          <p>Consider the private network address 192.168.1.0/24 shown in Figure 1. The first three octets are displayed in decimal, while the last octet is displayed in binary. The reason for this is because we will be borrowing bits from the last octet to create subnets of the 192.168.1.0/24 network.</p>
          <p>The subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 as indicated by the /24 prefix length. This identifies the first three octets as the network portion and the remaining 8 bits in the last octet as the host portion. Without subnetting, this network supports a single LAN interface providing 254 host IPv4 addresses. If an additional LAN is needed, the network would need to be subnetted.</p>
          <p>In Figure 2, 1 bit is borrowed from the most significant bit (leftmost bit) in the host portion, thus extending the network portion to 25 bits or /25. This enables the creation of two subnets.</p>
          <p>Figure 3 displays the two subnets: 192.168.1.0/25 and 192.168.1.128/25. The two subnets are derived from changing the value of the bit borrowed to either 0 or 1. Because the bit borrowed is the 128 bit, the decimal value of the fourth octet for the 2nd subnet is 128. </p>
          <p>Figure 4 displays the resulting subnet mask for both networks. Notice how it uses a 1 in the borrowed bit position to indicate that this bit is now part of the network portion.</p>
          <p>Figure 5 displays the dotted decimal representation of the two subnet addresses and their common subnet mask. Because one bit has been borrowed, the subnet mask for each subnet is 255.255.255.128 or /25.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows the network address 192.168.1.0/24 with the first three octets of the address in decimal and the last octet in binary. The address is over the subnet mask. The first three octets of the subnet mask are in decimal and the last octet is in binary. The host portion of both is all zeros. Figure 2 shows borrowing the first bit in the fourth octet. Figure 3 shows the two subnets one bit borrowed would create. Figure 4 shows that the borrowed bit becomes a one bit in the subnet mask. Figure 5 shows that the two subnets are 192.168.1.0/25 and 192.168.1.128/25 with the new subnet mask of 255.255.255.128.</div>
