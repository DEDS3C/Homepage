        <h1>Creating 2 Subnets</h1>
        <div>
          <p>To see how a /25 subnet is applied in a network; consider the topology in Figure 1. R1 has two LAN segments attached to its GigabitEthernet interfaces. Each LAN is assigned one of the subnets.</p>
          <p>Figure 2 displays the important addresses of the first subnet, 192.168.1.0/25. Notice how the: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>IPv4 Network address</b> is 192.168.1.0 and contains all 0 bits in the host portion of the address.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>First IPv4 host address</b> is 192.168.1.1 and contains all 0 bits plus a right-most 1 bit in the host portion of the address. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Last IPv4 host address</b> is 192.168.1.126 and contains all 1 bits plus a right-most 0 bit in the host portion of the address.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>IPv4 Broadcast address</b> is 192.168.1.127 and contains all 1 bits in the host portion of the address.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Figure 3 displays the important addresses of the second subnet, 192.168.1.128/25.</p>
          <p>Router interfaces must be assigned an IP address within the valid host range for the assigned subnet. This is the address that hosts on that network will use as their default gateway. A very common practice is to use the first or last available address in a network range for the router interface address. Figure 4 shows the configuration for R1â€™s interfaces with the first IPv4 address for their respective subnets using the <b>ip address </b>interface configuration command.</p>
          <p>Hosts on each subnet must be configured with an IPv4 address and default gateway.  Figure 5 displays the IPv4 configuration for PC2 host on the 192.168.1.128/25 network. Notice that the default gateway IPv4 address is the address configured on the G0/1 interface of R1, 192.168.1.129, and the subnet mask is 255.255.255.128. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows a topology with one router connected to two switches to create two LANs. The subnets 192.168.1.0/25 and 192.168.1.128/25 are assigned to the two LANs. Figure 2 shows the network address, first host address, last host address, and broadcast address for the 192.168.1.0/25 subnet. The last octet is in binary to show that a network address is all zeros in the host portion. The first host address is all zeros except the least significant bit in the host portion. The last host address is all ones except for the least significant bit in the host portion. And the broadcast address is all ones in the host portion. Similar to Figure 2, Figure 3 shows the network address, first host address, last host address, and broadcast address for the 192.168.1.128/25 subnet with the last octet shown in binary. Figure 4 shows the topology from Figure 1 with IP addresses assigned to the devices from the appropriate subnets. Figure 5 shows the TCP/IP Properties settings for Windows with static IP addressing assigned to one of the PCs from the second subnet.</div>
