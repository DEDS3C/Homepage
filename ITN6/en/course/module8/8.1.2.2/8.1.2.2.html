        <h1>Subnetting on the Octet Boundary</h1>
        <div>
          <p>To understand how subnetting on the octet boundary can be useful, consider the following example. Assume an enterprise has chosen the private address 10.0.0.0/8 as its internal network address. That network address can connect 16,777,214 hosts in one broadcast domain. Obviously, this is not ideal. </p>
          <p>The enterprise could further subnet the 10.0.0.0/8 address at the octet boundary of /16 as shown in Figure 1. This would provide the enterprise the ability to define up to 256 subnets (i.e., 10.0.0.0/16 â€“ 10.255.0.0/16) with each subnet capable of connecting 65,534 hosts. Notice how the first two octets identify the network portion of the address while the last two octets are for host IP addresses.</p>
          <p>Alternatively, the enterprise could choose to subnet at the /24 octet boundary as shown in Figure 2. This would enable the enterprise to define 65,536 subnets each capable of connecting 254 hosts. The /24 boundary is very popular in subnetting because it accommodates a reasonable number of hosts and conveniently subnets at the octet boundary.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows a table with all the possible subnets for 10.x.0.0/16. The first column is the subnet address. Although there are 256 possibilities, only the first seven and the last subnet are shown. The second column shows the host range for each subnet. Each subnet can support 65,534 hosts. The third column shows the broadcast address for each subnet. Figure 2 shows a table with all the possible subnets for 10.x.x.0/24. Although there are 65,536 possibilities, only nine are shown. The second column shows the host range for each subnet. Each subnet can support 254 hosts. The third column shows the broadcast address for each subnet.</div>
