        <h1>Octet Boundaries</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Every interface on a router is connected to a network. The IPv4 address and subnet mask configured on the router interface are used to identify the specific broadcast domain. Recall that the prefix length and the subnet mask are different ways of identifying the network portion of an address.</p>
          <p>IPv4 subnets are created by using one or more of the host bits as network bits. This is done by extending the subnet mask to borrow some of the bits from the host portion of the address to create additional network bits. The more host bits that are borrowed, the more subnets that can be defined. </p>
          <p>Networks are most easily subnetted at the octet boundary of /8, /16, and /24. The table in the figure identifies these prefix lengths, equivalent subnet masks, the network and host bits, and the number of hosts each subnet can connect. Notice that using longer prefix lengths decreases the number of hosts per subnet.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows a table. Column one has the prefix lengths /8, /16 and /24. Column two has the subnet masks 255.0.0.0, 255.255.0.0, and 255.255.255.0. Column three shows the subnet mask in binary. Above each binary one is the letter “n” to represent that this is a network bit. About each binary zero is the letter “h” to represent that this is a host bit. Column three shows the number of hosts for each prefix length: 16,777,214, 65,534, and 254. </div>
