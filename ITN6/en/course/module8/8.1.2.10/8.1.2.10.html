        <h1>Creating 4 Subnets</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Now consider the network topology shown in Figure 1. The enterprise is using the private network address 192.168.1.0/24 range and requires three subnets. Borrowing a single bit only provided 2 subnets; therefore, another host bit must be borrowed as shown in Figure 2. Using the <b>2^n</b> formula for two borrowed bits results in <b>2^2 = 4</b> subnets. The specifics of the four subnets are shown in Figure 3. The resulting subnet mask of /26 or 255.255.255.192 is used by all four subnets. </p>
          <p>To calculate the number of hosts, examine the last octet as shown in Figure 4. After borrowing 2 bits for the subnet, there are 6 host bits remaining. Apply the host calculation formula <b>2^n - 2</b> as shown to reveal that each subnet can support 62 host addresses. The significant addresses of the first subnet (i.e., Net 0) are displayed in Figure 5.</p>
          <p>Only the first three subnets are required because there are only three interfaces. Figure 6 displays the specifics of the first three subnets that will be used to satisfy the topology in Figure 1.  </p>
          <p>Finally, Figure 7 applies the first valid host address from each subnet to the respective R1 LAN interface.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows a topology with router 1 connected to two switches to create two LANs. Router 1 is then connected to router 2 to create a WAN. The subnets 192.168.1.0/26 and 192.168.1.64/25 are assigned to the two LANs. The subnet 192.168.1.128/26 is assigned to the WAN. Figure 2 shows borrowing the first two bits in the fourth octet. Figure 3 shows the four subnets two bits borrowed would create. Figure 4 shows the formula to calculate the number of hosts which is 2 to the 6 power minus two for 62 valid hosts. Figure 5 shows the network address, first host address, last host address, and broadcast address for the 192.168.1.0/26 subnet. The last octet is in binary to show that a network address is all zeros in the host portion. The first host address is all zeros except the least significant bit in the host portion. The last host address is all ones except for the least significant bit in the host portion. And the broadcast address is all ones in the host portion. Figure 6 is a table showing the three subnets that will be used in the topology with the network address, first host address, last host address, and broadcast address for each listed. Figure 7 shows the topology from Figure 1 with IP addresses assigned to the devices from the appropriate subnets. </div>
