        <h1>Reasons for Subnetting</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Subnetting reduces overall network traffic and improves network performance. It also enables an administrator to implement security policies such as which subnets are allowed or not allowed to communicate together.</p>
          <p>There are various ways of using subnets to help manage network devices. Network administrators can group devices and services into subnets that are determined by:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Location, such as floors in a building (Figure 1).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Organizational unit (Figure 2).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Device type (Figure 3).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Any other division that makes sense for the network. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Notice in each figure, the subnets use longer prefix lengths to identify networks.</p>
          <p>This chapter describes how subnetting is performed. Understanding how to subnet networks is a fundamental skill that all network administrators must develop. Various methods have been developed to help understand this process. This chapter will focus on looking at the binary method. Although a little overwhelming at first, focus and pay close attention to the detail and with practice, subnetting should become easier.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows a 5 story building. Each floor has its on switch attached to a router interface. Each floor is a separate network. Figure 2 shows a router connected to the Internet and to four LANs. Each LAN is assigned an organization unit: administration, human resource, students, accounting. Figure 3 shows a router connected to the Internet and to three LANs. Each LAN is assigned to a device type: all hosts, all servers, all printers.</div>
