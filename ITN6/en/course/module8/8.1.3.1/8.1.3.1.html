        <h1>Creating Subnets with a /16 prefix</h1>
        <div>
          <p>In a situation requiring a larger number of subnets, an IPv4 network is required that has more hosts bits to borrow from. For example, the network address 172.16.0.0 has a default mask of 255.255.0.0, or /16. This address has 16 bits in the network portion and 16 bits in the host portion. The 16 bits in the host portion are available to borrow for creating subnets. The table in the figure highlights all the possible scenarios for subnetting a /16 prefix. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Although a complete memorization of the table is not required, it is suggested that you gain a good understanding of how each value in the table is generated. Do not let the size of the table intimidate you. The reason it is big is because it has 8 additional bits that can be borrowed, and, therefore, the number of subnets and hosts are simply larger.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows a table. The first column lists the fourteen prefix lengths from /27 to /30. The second column lists the fourteen subnet masks from 255.255.128.0 to 255.255.255.252. The third column shows the subnet mask in binary with the letter “n” above one bits and the letter “h” above zero bits. The effect is to show the borrowing of bits into the third and fourth octet from borrowing one bit in the first row (/17) to borrowing fourteen bits in the last row (/30). The fourth and fifth columns show the number of subnets and hosts respectively. For example, borrowing 5 bits gets you 32 subnets with 2046 hosts per subnet.</div>
