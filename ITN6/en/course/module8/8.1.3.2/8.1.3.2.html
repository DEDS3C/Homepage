        <h1>Creating 100 Subnets with a /16 Network</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Consider a large enterprise that requires at least 100 subnets and has chosen the private address 172.16.0.0/16 as its internal network address. </p>
          <p>When borrowing bits from a /16 address, start borrowing bits in the third octet, going from left to right. Borrow a single bit at a time until the number of bits necessary to create 100 subnets is reached. </p>
          <p>Figure 1 displays the number of subnets that can be created when borrowing bits from the third octet and the fourth octet. Notice there is now up to 14 host bits that can be borrowed.</p>
          <p>To satisfy the requirements of the enterprise, 7 bits (i.e., 2^7 = 128 subnets) would need to be borrowed, as shown in Figure 2. </p>
          <p>Recall that the subnet mask must change to reflect the borrowed bits. In this example, when 7 bits are borrowed, the mask is extended 7 bits into the third octet. In decimal, the mask is represented as 255.255.254.0, or a /23 prefix, because the third octet is 11111110 in binary and the fourth octet is 00000000 in binary. </p>
          <p>Figure 3 displays the resulting subnets from 172.16.0.0 /23 up to 172.16.254.0 /23. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows the formula for calculating the number of subnets based on the bits borrowed from 1 bit borrowed all the way to 14 bits borrowed. For example borrowing 7 bits gets you 2 to the power of 7 or 128 subnets. Figure 2 shows the network address 172.16.0.0/23. The last two octets are in binary. The subnet mask is shown below the network address with the seven bits borrowed now as one bits. Figure 3 shows the first three subnets and the last subnet created by borrowing 7 bits. The last two octets are shown in binary.</div>
