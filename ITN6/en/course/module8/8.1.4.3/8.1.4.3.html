        <h1>Network Requirement Example</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Network administrators must devise the network addressing scheme to accommodate the maximum number of hosts for each network and the number of subnets. The addressing scheme should allow for growth in the both the number of host addresses per subnet and the total number of subnets.</p>
          <p>In this example, corporate headquarters has allocated a private network address of 172.16.0.0/22 (10 host bits) to a branch location. As shown in Figure 1, this will provide 1,022 host addresses.</p>
          <p>The topology for the branch locations, shown in Figure 2, consists of 5 LAN segments and 4 internetwork connections between routers. Therefore, 9 subnets are required. The largest subnet requires 40 hosts. </p>
          <p>The 172.16.0.0/22 network address has 10 host bits as shown in Figure 3. Because the largest subnet requires 40 hosts, a minimum of 6 host bits are needed to provide addressing for 40 hosts. This is determined by using this formula: 2^6 â€“ 2 = 62 hosts. </p>
          <p>Using the formula for determining subnets, results in 16 subnets: 2^4 = 16. Because the example internetwork requires 9 subnets this will meet the requirement and allow for some additional growth. </p>
          <p>Therefore, the first 4 host bits can be used to allocate subnets, as shown in Figure 4. When 4 bits are borrowed, the new prefix length is /26 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.192.</p>
          <p>As shown in Figure 5, the subnets can be assigned to the LAN segments and router-to-router connections.</p>
          <p>This topic concludes with four activities to practice subnetting. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows how a slash 22 has ten host bits which allows for 1022 valid hosts. Figure 2 shows a corporate network divided by department. The host requirements for each department are listed. Figure 3 shows the 172.16.0.0/22 address in binary. The network portion is highlighted in green and the host portion is highlighted in orange. Figure 4 shows the 16 subnets that are formed when creating borrowing four bits from 172.16.0.0/22.  You can see that by alternating bits 23, 24, 25, and 26 in a logical order, you can easily determine the network IDs for all sixteen subnets. Figure 5 shows how these subnets might be assigned to the departments in a corporate network.  Each subnet is the same size.</div>
