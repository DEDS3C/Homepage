        <div>
          <p>Using the VLSM subnets, the LAN and WAN segments can be addressed without unnecessary waste.</p>
          <p>As shown in Figure 1, the hosts in each of the LANs will be assigned a valid host address with the range for that subnet and /27 mask. Each of the four routers will have a LAN interface with a /27 subnet and a one or more serial interfaces with a /30 subnet.</p>
          <p>Using a common addressing scheme, the first host IPv4 address for each subnet is assigned to the LAN interface of the router. The WAN interfaces of the routers are assigned the IP addresses and mask for the /30 subnets.</p>
          <p>Figures 2 - 5 show the interface configuration for each of the routers.</p>
          <p>Hosts on each subnet will have a host IPv4 address from the range of host addresses for that subnet and an appropriate mask. Hosts will use the address of the attached router LAN interface as the default gateway address. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows a four router topology. R1 is connected to R2. R2 is connected to R3. R3 is connected to R4. Each router has a LAN. The LANs are assign /27 subnets and the WAN links between the routers are assigned /30 subnets. Figure 2 shows the configuration commands to configure the interfaces on R1 for building A. Figure 3 shows the configuration commands to configure the interfaces on R2 for building B. Figure 4 shows the configuration commands to configure the interfaces on R3 for building C. Figure 5 shows the configuration commands to configure the interfaces on R4 for building D.</div>
