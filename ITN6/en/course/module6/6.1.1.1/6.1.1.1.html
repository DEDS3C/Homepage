        <h1>The Network Layer</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The network layer, or OSI Layer 3, provides services to allow end devices to exchange data across the network. To accomplish this end-to-end transport, the network layer uses four basic processes:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Addressing end devices</b> - End devices must be configured with a unique IP address for identification on the network. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Encapsulation - </b>The network layer encapsulates the protocol data unit (PDU) from the transport layer into a packet. The encapsulation process adds IP header information, such as the IP address of the source (sending) and destination (receiving) hosts. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Routing - </b>The network layer provides services to direct packets to a destination host on another network. To travel to other networks, the packet must be processed by a router. The role of the router is to select the best path and direct packets toward the destination host in a process known as routing. A packet may cross many intermediary devices before reaching the destination host. Each router a packet crosses to reach the destination host is called a hop. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>De-encapsulation - </b>When the packet arrives at the network layer of the destination host, the host checks the IP header of the packet. If the destination IP address within the header matches its own IP address, the IP header is removed from the packet. After the packet is de-encapsulated by the network layer, the resulting Layer 4 PDU is passed up to the appropriate service at the transport layer.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Unlike the transport layer (OSI Layer 4), which manages the data transport between the processes running on each host, network layer protocols specify the packet structure and processing used to carry the data from one host to another host. Operating without regard to the data carried in each packet allows the network layer to carry packets for multiple types of communications between multiple hosts.</p>
