        <h1>Default Gateway for a Host</h1>
        <div>
          <p>For an end device to communicate over the network, it must be configured with the correct IP address information, including the default gateway address. The default gateway is only used when the host wants to send a packet to a device on another network. The default gateway address is generally the router interface address attached to the local network of the host. The IP address of the host device and the router interface address must be in the same network. </p>
          <p>The network topology in Figure 1 and 2 consists of a router interconnecting two separate LANs. G0/0 is connected to network 192.168.10.0, while G0/1 is connected to network 192.168.11.0. Each host device is configured with the appropriate default gateway address. </p>
          <p>In Figure 1, PC1 sends a packet to PC2. In this example, the default gateway is not used. Instead, PC1 addresses the packet with the IP address of PC2 and forwards the packet directly to PC2 through the switch. </p>
          <p>In Figure 2, PC1 sends a packet to PC3. In this example, PC1 addresses the packet with the IP address of PC3, but then forwards the packet to the router. The router accepts the packet, accesses its routing table to determine the appropriate exit interface based on the destination address, and then forwards the packet out of the appropriate interface to reach PC3.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows a router with two LANs.  Each LAN has 2 PCs.  This figure shows how a host can communicate with another host on the same LAN without the use of the gateway. Figure 2 shows a router with two LANs.  Each LAN has 2 PCs . This figure shows how a host requires the gateway to communicate with a host on another LAN.</div>
