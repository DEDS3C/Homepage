        <h1>Introducing IPv6</h1>
        <div>
          <p>In the early 1990s, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) grew concerned about the issues with IPv4 and began to look for a replacement. This activity led to the development of IP version 6 (IPv6). IPv6 overcomes the limitations of IPv4 and is a powerful enhancement with features that better suit current and foreseeable network demands. </p>
          <p>Improvements that IPv6 provides include:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Increased address space - </b>IPv6 addresses are based on 128-bit hierarchical addressing as opposed to IPv4 with 32 bits. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Improved packet handling - </b>The IPv6 header has been simplified with fewer fields. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Eliminates the need for NAT - </b>With such a large number of public IPv6 addresses, NAT between a private IPv4 address and a public IPv4 is not needed. This avoids some of the NAT-induced application problems experienced by applications requiring end-to-end connectivity.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The 32-bit IPv4 address space provides approximately 4,294,967,296 unique addresses. IPv6 address space provides 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456, or 340 undecillion addresses, which is roughly equivalent to every grain of sand on Earth.</p>
          <p>The figure provides a visual to compare the IPv4 and IPv6 address space. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows a table that shows number names from Thousand to Undecillion.  The table includes a column for the name, a column with scientific notation and a column showing a 1 with a number of zeros.  There are 347 undecillion IPv6 addresses.  Undecillion is a 1 with 36 zeros or ten raised to the 36th power.</div>
