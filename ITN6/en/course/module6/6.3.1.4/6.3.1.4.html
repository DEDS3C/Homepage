        <h1>Inside a Router</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Although there are several different types and models of routers, every router has the same general hardware components. </p>
          <p>The figure shows the inside of a Cisco 1841 first generation ISR. Click the components to see a brief description of each. The figure also includes images of other components found in a router, such as the power supply, cooling fan, heat shields, and an advanced integration module (AIM), which are beyond the scope of this chapter.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: A networking professional should be familiar with and understand the function of the main internal components of a router, rather than the exact location of those components inside a specific router. Depending on the model, those components are located in different places inside the router.</p>

      <div id="media-description">This interactive activity shows a picture of the inside of an 1941 router.  Some of the components are highlighted and when you click them a callout tells what it is with a brief description.  Components include: power supply and fan; CPU, RAM, and ROM chips; two high-speed WAN interface cards; and an Advanced Integration Module (AIM), which can be used to offload processor-intensive functions, such as encryption, from the main CPU; </div>
