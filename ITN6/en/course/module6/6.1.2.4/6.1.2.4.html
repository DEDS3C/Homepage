        <h1>IP - Best Effort Delivery</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The figure illustrates the unreliable or best-effort delivery characteristic of the IP protocol. The IP protocol does not guarantee that all packets that are delivered are, in fact, received. </p>
          <p>Unreliable means that IP does not have the capability to manage and recover from undelivered or corrupt packets. This is because while IP packets are sent with information about the location of delivery, they contain no information that can be processed to inform the sender whether delivery was successful. Packets may arrive at the destination corrupted, out of sequence, or not at all. IP provides no capability for packet retransmissions if errors occur. </p>
          <p>If out-of-order packets are delivered, or packets are missing, then applications using the data, or upper layer services, must resolve these issues. This allows IP to function very efficiently. In the TCP/IP protocol suite, reliability is the role of the transport layer.</p>
