        <h1>IPv4 Router Routing Table</h1>
        <div>
          <p>On a Cisco IOS router, the <b>show ip route</b> command can be used to display the routerâ€™s IPv4 routing table, as shown in the figure. </p>
          <p>In addition to providing routing information for directly-connected networks and remote networks, the routing table also has information on how the route was learned, the trustworthiness and rating of the route, when the route was last updated, and which interface to use to reach the requested destination.</p>
          <p>When a packet arrives at the router interface, the router examines the packet header to determine the destination network. If the destination network matches a route in the routing table, the router forwards the packet using the information specified in the routing table. If there are two or more possible routes to the same destination, the metric is used to decide which route appears in the routing table.</p>
          <p>The figure shows the routing table of R1 depicted in the network diagram.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows two routers connected by a serial connection.  Each router has two LANs attached.  The output from "show ip route" is displayed for one of the routers. The output contains all networks that this router has in its routing table.  They include the directly connected networks, denoted by a "C" in the routing table and the remote networks, denoted by a different code depending on the routing protocol running on the router.  This router is running EIGRP so the code is a "D".  For each directly connected network there are 2 entries.  One with a code of "C" and one with a code of "L".  The "L" is new as of IOS 15 and refers to local networks.</div>
