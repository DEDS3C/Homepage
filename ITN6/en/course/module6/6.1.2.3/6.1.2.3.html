        <h1>IP - Connectionless</h1>
        <div>
          <p>IP is connectionless, meaning that no dedicated end-to-end connection is created before data is sent. As shown in Figure 1, connectionless communication is conceptually similar to sending a letter to someone without notifying the recipient in advance.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Connectionless data communications work on the same principle. As shown in Figure 2, IP requires no initial exchange of control information to establish an end-to-end connection before packets are forwarded. IP also does not require additional fields in the header to maintain an established connection. This process greatly reduces the overhead of IP. However, with no pre-established end-to-end connection, senders are unaware whether destination devices are present and functional when sending packets, nor are they aware if the destination receives the packet, or if they are able to access and read the packet.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows a standard letter being placed into a mailbox with a truck delivering the letter to a house.  This demonstrates the similarities between Internet communications and the postal service. Figure 2 shows 2 computers connected to a network and a layer 3 packet traversing the network.</div>
