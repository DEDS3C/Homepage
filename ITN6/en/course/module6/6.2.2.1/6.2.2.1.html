        <h1>Router Packet Forwarding Decision</h1>
        <div>
          <p>When a host sends a packet to another host, it will use its routing table to determine where to send the packet. If the destination host is on a remote network, the packet is forwarded to the default gateway. </p>
          <p>What happens when a packet arrives at the default gateway, which is usually a router? The router looks at its routing table to determine where to forward packets.</p>
          <p>The routing table of a router can store information about:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Directly-connected routes - </b>These routes come from the active router interfaces. Routers add a directly connected route when an interface is configured with an IP address and is activated. Each of the router's interfaces is connected to a different network segment. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Remote routes - </b>These routes come from remote networks connected to other routers. Routes to these networks can be manually configured on the local router by the network administrator or dynamically configured by enabling the local router to exchange routing information with other routers using a dynamic routing protocol.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Default route </b>â€“ Like a host, routers also use a default route as a last resort if there is no other route to the desired network in the routing table.    </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows two routers connected by a serial connection.  Each router has two LANs attached.  This figure shows that a router has its own routing table to consult should a packet be destined for a remote network.  The routing table consists of directly connected networks and remote networks.</div>
