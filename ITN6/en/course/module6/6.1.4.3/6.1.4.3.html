        <h1>Encapsulating IPv6</h1>
        <div>
          <p>One of the major design improvements of IPv6 over IPv4 is the simplified IPv6 header. </p>
          <p>For instance, the IPv4 header shown in Figure 1 consists of 20 octets (up to 60 bytes if the Options field is used) and 12 basic header fields, not including the Options field and Padding field. As highlighted in the figure, for IPv6, some fields have remained the same, some fields have changed names and positions, and some IPv4 fields are no longer required. </p>
          <p>In contrast, the simplified IPv6 header shown in Figure 2 consists of 40 octets (largely due to the length of the source and destination IPv6 addresses) and 8 header fields (3 IPv4 basic header fields and 5 additional header fields).  As highlighted in this figure, some fields have kept the same names as IPv4, some fields have changed names or positions, and a new field has been added. </p>
          <p>The IPv6 simplified header offers several advantages over IPv4 as listed in Figure 3. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figures 1 and 2 compare the IPv4 and IPv6 headers. In the IPv4 header, there are fields shaded in yellow (version, source I.P. address and destination I.P. address) that were kept in IPv 6.  There are fields shaded in green (type of service, total length, time to live and protocol) that were renamed or repositioned in IPv6 and the fields shaded in gray were dropped in IPv6. The IPv6 header has a new field called flow label. The advantages of IPv6 are listed in Figure 3. These advantages include: better routing efficiency for performance and forwarding-rate scalability; no requirement for processing checksums; simplified and more efficient extension header mechanisms (as opposed to the IPv4 Options field); and a Flow Label field for per-flow processing with no need to open the transport inner packet to identify the various traffic flows.</div>
