        <h1>IPv4 Packet Header</h1>
        <div>
          <p>An IPv4 packet header consists of fields containing important information about the packet. These fields contain binary numbers which are examined by the Layer 3 process. The binary values of each field identify various settings of the IP packet. Protocol header diagrams, which are read left to right, and top down, provide a visual to refer to when discussing protocol fields. The IP protocol header diagram in the figure identifies the fields of an IPv4 packet.</p>
          <p>Significant fields in the IPv4 header include:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Version - </b>Contains a 4-bit binary value set to 0100 that identifies this as an IP version 4 packet. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Differentiated Services or DiffServ (DS) - </b>Formerly called the Type of Service (ToS) field, the DS field is an 8-bit field used to determine the priority of each packet. The six most significant bits of the DiffServ field is the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) and the last two bits are the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) bits.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Time-to-Live (TTL) - </b>Contains an 8-bit binary value that is used to limit the lifetime of a packet. The packet sender sets the initial TTL value, and it is decreased by one each time the packet is processed by a router. If the TTL field decrements to zero, the router discards the packet and sends an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Time Exceeded message to the source IP address. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Protocol - </b>Field is used to identify the next level protocol. This 8-bit binary value indicates the data payload type that the packet is carrying, which enables the network layer to pass the data to the appropriate upper-layer protocol. Common values include ICMP (1), TCP (6), and UDP (17).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Source IPv4 Address - </b>Contains a 32-bit binary value that represents the source IPv4 address of the packet. The source IPv4 address is always a unicast address.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Destination IPv4 Address - </b>Contains a 32-bit binary value that represents the destination IPv4 address of the packet. The destination IPv4 address is a unicast, multicast, or broadcast address.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The two most commonly referenced fields are the source and destination IP addresses. These fields identify where the packet is coming from and where it is going. Typically these addresses do not change while travelling from the source to the destination.</p>
          <p>The Internet Header Length (IHL), Total Length, and Header Checksum fields are used to identify and validate the packet.</p>
          <p>Other fields are used to reorder a fragmented packet. Specifically, the IPv4 packet uses Identification, Flags, and Fragment Offset fields to keep track of the fragments. A router may have to fragment a packet when forwarding it from one medium to another with a smaller MTU. </p>
          <p>The Options and Padding fields are rarely used and are beyond the scope of this chapter.</p>

These include Version, Differentiated Services (comprised of a code and explicit congestion notification), Time to live,  protocol and the source and destination IP addresses.
