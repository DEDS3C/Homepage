        <h1>Positional Notation</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Learning to convert binary to decimal requires an understanding of <i>positional notation</i>. Positional notation means that a digit represents different values depending on the “position” the digit occupies in the sequence of numbers. You already know the most common numbering system, the decimal (base 10) notation system.  </p>
          <p>The decimal positional notation system operates as described in Figure 1. Click the row titles for a description of each row. To use the positional system, match a given number to its positional value. The example in Figure 2 illustrates how positional notation is used with the decimal number 1234. </p>
          <p>In contrast, the binary positional notation operates as described in Figure 3. Click the row titles for a description of each row.</p>
          <p>The example in Figure 4 illustrates how a binary number 11000000 corresponds to the number 192. If the binary number had been 10101000, then the corresponding decimal number would be 168.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows a chart for decimal positional notation. The first row is label radix and has the number 10 listed in three columns. The second row is labeled “Position in #” and has 3 in the thousands place, 2 in the hundreds place, 1 in the tens place, and 0 in the ones place. The third row is labeled “Calculate” and has the exponential formula for each position: 10 to the 3rd power, 10 to the 2nd power, 10 to the first power, and 10 to the zero power. The fourth row is labeled “Positional Value” with 1000, 100, 10, and 1. Clicking on the row headings opens a textbox with more information. Figure 2 shows an example of applying decimal positional notation for the number 1234. The number 1 is place in the thousands, 2 is place in the hundreds, 3 is placed in the tens, and 4 is placed in the ones. The result is 1234. Figure 3 shows a chart for binary positional notation. The first row is label radix and has the number 2 listed in eight columns. The second row is labeled “Position in #” and has 7 in the 128 place, 6 in the 64 place, 5 in the 32 place, 4 in the 16 place, 3 in the 8 place, 2 in the 4 place, 1 in the 2 place, and 0 in the 1 place. The third row is labeled “Calculate” and has the exponential formula for each position: 2 to the 7th power all the way to 2 to the zero power. The fourth row is labeled “Positional Value” with 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1. Clicking on the row headings opens a textbox with more information. Figure 4 shows an example of applying binary positional notation for the binary number 11000000. The first 1 is place in the 128 place and the second 1 is place in the 64 place. Adding them up results in a value of 192.</div>
