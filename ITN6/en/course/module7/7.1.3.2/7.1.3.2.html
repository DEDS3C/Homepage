        <h1>Dynamic IPv4 Address Assignment to a Host</h1>
        <div>
          <p>In most data networks, the largest population of hosts includes PCs, tablets, smartphones, printers, and IP phones. It is also often the case that the user population and their devices change frequently. It would be impractical to statically assign IPv4 addresses for each device. Therefore, these devices are assigned IPv4 addresses dynamically using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). </p>
          <p>As shown in the figure, a host can obtain IPv4 addressing information automatically. The host is a DHCP client and requests IPv4 address information from a DHCP server. The DHCP server provides an IPv4 address, subnet mask, default gateway, and other configuration information. </p>
          <p>DHCP is generally the preferred method of assigning IPv4 addresses to hosts on large networks. An additional benefit of DHCP is the address is not permanently assigned to a host but is only "leased" for a period of time. If the host is powered down or taken off the network, the address is returned to the pool for reuse. This feature is especially helpful for mobile users that come and go on a network.</p>
