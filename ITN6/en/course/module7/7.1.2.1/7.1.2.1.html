        <h1>Network and Host Portions</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Understanding binary notation is important when determining if two hosts are in the same network. Recall that an IPv4 address is a hierarchical address that is made up of a network portion and a host portion. When determining the network portion versus the host portion, it is necessary to look at the 32-bit stream. Within the 32-bit stream, a portion of the bits identify the network, and a portion of the bits identify the host as shown in the figure.</p>
          <p>The bits within the network portion of the address must be identical for all devices that reside in the same network. The bits within the host portion of the address must be unique to identify a specific host within a network. If two hosts have the same bit-pattern in the specified network portion of the 32-bit stream, those two hosts will reside in the same network. </p>
          <p>But how do hosts know which portion of the 32-bits identifies the network and which identifies the host? That is the job of the <i>subnet mask</i>.</p>
