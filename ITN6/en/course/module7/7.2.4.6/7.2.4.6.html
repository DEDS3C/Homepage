        <h1>Dynamic Link-Local Addresses</h1>
        <div>
          <p>All IPv6 devices must have an IPv6 link-local address. A link-local address can be established dynamically or configured manually as a static link-local address. </p>
          <p>Figure 1 shows the link-local address is dynamically created using the FE80::/10 prefix and the Interface ID using the EUI-64 process or a randomly generated 64-bit number. Operating systems will typically use the same method for both a SLAAC created global unicast address and a dynamically assigned link-local address, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
          <p>Cisco routers automatically create an IPv6 link-local address whenever a global unicast address is assigned to the interface. By default, Cisco IOS routers use EUI-64 to generate the Interface ID for all link-local address on IPv6 interfaces. For serial interfaces, the router will use the MAC address of an Ethernet interface. Recall that a link-local address must be unique only on that link or network. However, a drawback to using the dynamically assigned link-local address is its long interface ID, which makes it challenging to identify and remember assigned addresses. Figure 3 displays the MAC address on router R1’s GigabitEthernet 0/0 interface. This address is used to dynamically create the link-local address on the same interface.</p>
          <p>To make it easier to recognize and remember these addresses on routers, it is common to statically configure IPv6 link-local addresses on routers.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows the format of an IPv6 link-local address.  The figure highlights the first ten binary bits set to 1111111010, which is FE80::/10 ten. The remaining 54 bits in the prefix are normally set to zero. The 64 bit interface ID can be derived either through EUI-64 or a randomly generated 64-bit number. Figure 2 shows two Windows command line windows. Both windows show the “ipconfig” command output. In the top window, the link-local address was generated using EUI-64. In the bottom window, the link-local address was created using a randomly generated 64-bit number for the interface ID. Figure 3 shows the output on a router for the “show interface gigabitethernet 0/0” command. The MAC address, fc99.4775.c3e0, is highlighted. The second command entered is “show ipv6 interface brief”. Output from this command verifies that the router is using the same link-local address on all three active IPv6 interfaces. The link-local address was generated using EUI-64.</div>
