        <h1>Unicast Transmission</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Unicast communication is used for normal host-to-host communication in both a client/server and a peer-to-peer network. Unicast packets use the address of the destination device as the destination address and can be routed through an internetwork. </p>
          <p>Play the animation to see an example of unicast transmission.</p>
          <p>In an IPv4 network, the unicast address applied to an end device is referred to as the host address. For unicast communication, the addresses assigned to the two end devices are used as the source and destination IPv4 addresses. During the encapsulation process, the source host uses its IPv4 address as the source address and the IPv4 address of the destination host as the destination address. Regardless of whether the destination specified a packet as a unicast, broadcast or multicast; the source address of any packet is always the unicast address of the originating host. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: In this course, all communication between devices is unicast unless otherwise noted.</p>
          <p>IPv4 unicast host addresses are in the address range of 0.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255. However, within this range are many addresses that are reserved for special purposes. These special purpose addresses will be discussed later in this chapter.</p>
