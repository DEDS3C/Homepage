        <h1>Structure of an IPv6 Global Unicast Address</h1>
        <div>
          <p>IPv6 global unicast addresses (GUA) are globally unique and routable on the IPv6 Internet. These addresses are equivalent to public IPv4 addresses. The Internet Committee for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the operator for IANA, allocates IPv6 address blocks to the five RIRs. Currently, only global unicast addresses with the first three bits of 001 or 2000::/3 are being assigned. In other words, the first hexadecimal digit of a GUA address will begin with a 2 or a 3. This is only 1/8th of the total available IPv6 address space, excluding only a very small portion for other types of unicast and multicast addresses. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: The 2001:0DB8::/32 address has been reserved for documentation purposes, including use in examples. </p>
          <p>Figure 1 shows the structure and range of a global unicast address.</p>
          <p>A global unicast address has three parts:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Global routing prefix</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Subnet ID</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Interface ID</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Global Routing Prefix</b>
          </p>
          <p>The global routing prefix is the prefix, or network, portion of the address that is assigned by the provider, such as an ISP, to a customer or site. Typically, RIRs assign a /48 global routing prefix to customers. This can include everyone from enterprise business networks to individual households. </p>
          <p>Figure 2 shows the structure of a global unicast address using a /48 global routing prefix. /48 prefixes are the most common global routing prefixes assigned and will be used in most of the examples throughout this course. </p>
          <p>For example, the IPv6 address 2001:0DB8:ACAD::/48 has a prefix that indicates that the first 48 bits (3 hextets) (2001:0DB8:ACAD) is the prefix or network portion of the address. The double colon (::) prior to the /48 prefix length means the rest of the address contains all 0s.</p>
          <p>The size of the global routing prefix determines the size of the subnet ID.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Subnet ID</b>
          </p>
          <p>The Subnet ID is used by an organization to identify subnets within its site. The larger the subnet ID, the more subnets available.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Interface ID</b>
          </p>
          <p>The IPv6 Interface ID is equivalent to the host portion of an IPv4 address. The term Interface ID is used because a single host may have multiple interfaces, each having one or more IPv6 addresses. It is highly recommended that in most cases /64 subnets should be used. In other words a 64-bit interface ID as shown in Figure 2. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Unlike IPv4, in IPv6, the all-0s and all-1s host addresses can be assigned to a device. The all-1s address can be used due to the fact that broadcast addresses are not used within IPv6. The all-0s address can also be used, but is reserved as a Subnet-Router anycast address, and should be assigned only to routers.</p>
          <p>An easy way to read most IPv6 addresses is to count the number of hextets. As shown in Figure 3, in a /64 global unicast address the first four hextets are for the network portion of the address, with the fourth hextet indicating the Subnet ID. The remaining four hextets are for the Interface ID. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows the first three bits in an IPv6 global unicast address are set to 001.  The figure shows the range of binary bits for the first hextet to be from 2000 to 3FFF. Figure 2 shows the IPv6 global routing prefix of /48.  The first 48 bits serve as the global routing prefix and the next sixteen bits are used as a subnet identifier.  The /48 routing prefix plus the 16 bit subnet identifier form the /64 prefix.   The remaining 64 bits are the interface identifier. Figure 3 shows how to read a global unicast address.  The address is listed first as a compressed address, 2001:DB8:ACAD:1::10/64.  The first four hextets is the prefix and the last four hextets is the interface identifier.  This expands to 2001:0DB8:ACAD:0001:0000:0000:0000:0010 /64.  The global routing prefix is 2001:0DB8:ACAD.  The subnet ID is 0001 and the interface ID is 0000:0000:0000:0200.</div>
