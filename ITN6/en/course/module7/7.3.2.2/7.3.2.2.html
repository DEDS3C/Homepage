        <h1>Ping – Testing Connectivity to the Local LAN</h1>
        <div>
          <p>You can also use ping to test the ability of a host to communicate on the local network. This is generally done by pinging the IP address of the gateway of the host. A ping to the gateway indicates that the host and the router interface serving as the gateway are both operational on the local network. </p>
          <p>For this test, the gateway address is most often used because the router is normally always operational. If the gateway address does not respond, a ping can be sent to the IP address of another host on the local network that is known to be operational. </p>
          <p>If either the gateway or another host responds, then the local host can successfully communicate over the local network. If the gateway does not respond but another host does, this could indicate a problem with the router interface serving as the gateway. </p>
          <p>One possibility is that the wrong gateway address has been configured on the host. Another possibility is that the router interface may be fully operational but have security applied to it that prevents it from processing or responding to ping requests. </p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure shows a router with a switch connected to its FastEthernet 0/1 port and the port has an IPv4 address of 10.0.0.254.  The switch has a computer connected to it and the computer has an IPv4 address of 10.0.0.1.  The computer is testing connectivity to the router, which is the default gateway, by using ping to send an echo request to the router port.  The command used is ping 10.0.0.254.  The router responds with an echo reply.</div>
