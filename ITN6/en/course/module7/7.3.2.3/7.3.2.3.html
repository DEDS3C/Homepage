        <h1>Ping – Testing Connectivity to Remote</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Ping can also be used to test the ability of a local host to communicate across an internetwork. The local host can ping an operational IPv4 host of a remote network, as shown in the figure.</p>
          <p>If this ping is successful, the operation of a large piece of the internetwork can be verified. A successful ping across the internetwork confirms communication on the local network, the operation of the router serving as the gateway, and the operation of all other routers that might be in the path between the local network and the network of the remote host.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the functionality of the remote host can be verified. If the remote host could not communicate outside of its local network, it would not have responded. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Many network administrators limit or prohibit the entry of ICMP messages into the corporate network; therefore, the lack of a ping response could be due to security restrictions.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure is an animation that shows a computer sending an echo request to a remote host.  The echo request is sent to a switch, and is then forwarded to a router.  The receiving router sends the request to a switch, which then directs it to the destination host.  The host will respond by sending an echo reply back to the sender.</div>
