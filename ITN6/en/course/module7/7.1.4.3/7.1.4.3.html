        <h1>Special User IPv4 Addresses</h1>
        <div>
          <p>There are certain addresses such as the network address and broadcast address that cannot be assigned to hosts. There are also special addresses that can be assigned to hosts, but with restrictions on how those hosts can interact within the network. </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Loopback addresses (127.0.0.0 /8 or 127.0.0.1 to 127.255.255.254) – </b>More commonly identified as only 127.0.0.1, these are special addresses used by a host to direct traffic to itself. For example, it can be used on a host to test if the TCP/IP configuration is operational, such as shown in the figure. Notice how the 127.0.0.1 loopback address replies to the ping command. Also note how any address within this block will loop back to the local host, such as shown with the second ping in the figure. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Link-Local addresses (169.254.0.0 /16 or 169.254.0.1 to 169.254.255.254) – </b>More commonly known as the Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) addresses, they are used by a Windows DHCP client to self-configure in the event that there are no DHCP servers available.<b></b>Useful in a peer-to-peer connection.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>TEST-NET addresses (192.0.2.0/24 or 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255) – </b>These addresses are set aside for teaching and learning purposes and can be used in documentation and network examples. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: There are also Experimental Addresses in the block 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.254 that are reserved for future use (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3330" target="_blank">RFC 3330</a>).</p>
