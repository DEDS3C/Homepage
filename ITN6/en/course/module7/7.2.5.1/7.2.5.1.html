        <h1>Assigned IPv6 Multicast Addresses</h1>
        <div>
          <p>IPv6 multicast addresses are similar to IPv4 multicast addresses. Recall that a multicast address is used to send a single packet to one or more destinations (multicast group). IPv6 multicast addresses have the prefix FF00::/8. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Multicast addresses can only be destination addresses and not source addresses.</p>
          <p>There are two types of IPv6 multicast addresses:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Assigned multicast</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Solicited node multicast</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Assigned Multicast</b>
          </p>
          <p>Assigned multicast addresses are reserved multicast addresses for predefined groups of devices. An assigned multicast address is a single address used to reach a group of devices running a common protocol or service. Assigned multicast addresses are used in context with specific protocols such as DHCPv6. </p>
          <p>Two common IPv6 assigned multicast groups include:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>FF02::1 All-nodes multicast group</b> – This is a multicast group that all IPv6-enabled devices join. A packet sent to this group is received and processed by all IPv6 interfaces on the link or network. This has the same effect as a broadcast address in IPv4. The figure shows an example of communication using the all-nodes multicast address. An IPv6 router sends Internet Control Message Protocol version 6 (ICMPv6) RA messages to the all-node multicast group. The RA message informs all IPv6-enabled devices on the network about addressing information, such as the prefix, prefix length, and default gateway. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>FF02::2 All-routers multicast group</b> – This is a multicast group that all IPv6 routers join. A router becomes a member of this group when it is enabled as an IPv6 router with the <b>ipv6 unicast-routing</b> global configuration command. A packet sent to this group is received and processed by all IPv6 routers on the link or network. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>IPv6-enabled devices send ICMPv6 Router Solicitation (RS) messages to the all-routers multicast address. The RS message requests an RA message from the IPv6 router to assist the device in its address configuration. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows a router with a switch connected to one gigabit Ethernet port. There are 2 computers, a server, and a printer connected to the switch.  The router is sending an IPv6 all-nodes multicast message to destination address FF02::1.  The message is sent out to all the IPv6 enabled devices that are connected to the switch.  </div>
