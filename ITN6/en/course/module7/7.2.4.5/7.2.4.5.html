        <h1>EUI-64 Process and Randomly Generated</h1>
        <div>
          <p>When the RA message is either SLAAC or SLAAC with stateless DHCPv6, the client must generate its own Interface ID. The client knows the prefix portion of the address from the RA message but must create its own Interface ID. The Interface ID can be created using the EUI-64 process or a randomly generated 64-bit number, as shown in Figure 1.</p>
          <p>
            <b>EUI-64 Process</b>
          </p>
          <p>IEEE defined the Extended Unique Identifier (EUI) or modified EUI-64 process. This process uses a client’s 48-bit Ethernet MAC address, and inserts another 16 bits in the middle of the 48-bit MAC address to create a 64-bit Interface ID. </p>
          <p>Ethernet MAC addresses are usually represented in hexadecimal and are made up of two parts: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)</b> – The OUI is a 24-bit (6 hexadecimal digits) vendor code assigned by IEEE.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Device Identifier </b>– The device identifier is a unique 24-bit (6 hexadecimal digits) value within a common OUI. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>An EUI-64 Interface ID is represented in binary and is made up of three parts:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>24-bit OUI from the client MAC address, but the 7th bit (the Universally/Locally (U/L) bit) is reversed. This means that if the 7th bit is a 0, it becomes a 1, and vice versa. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The inserted 16-bit value FFFE (in hexadecimal).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>24-bit Device Identifier from the client MAC address.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The EUI-64 process is illustrated in Figure 2, using R1’s GigabitEthernet MAC address of FC99:4775:CEE0.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 1:</b> Divide the MAC address between the OUI and device identifier.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 2:</b> Insert the hexadecimal value FFFE, which in binary is: 1111 1111 1111 1110. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Step 3:</b> Convert the first 2 hexadecimal values of the OUI to binary and flip the U/L bit (bit 7). In this example, the 0 in bit 7 is changed to a 1.</p>
          <p>The result is an EUI-64 generated Interface ID of FE99:47FF:FE75:CEE0. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: The use of the U/L bit, and the reasons for reversing its value, are discussed in RFC 5342.</p>
          <p>Figure 3 shows PCA’s IPv6 global unicast address dynamically created using SLAAC and the EUI-64 process. An easy way to identify that an address was more than likely created using EUI-64 is the FFFE located in the middle of the Interface ID, as shown in Figure 3.</p>
          <p>The advantage of EUI-64 is the Ethernet MAC address can be used to determine the Interface ID. It also allows network administrators to easily track an IPv6 address to an end-device using the unique MAC address. However, this has caused privacy concerns among many users. They are concerned that their packets can be traced to the actual physical computer. Due to these concerns, a randomly generated Interface ID may be used instead.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Randomly Generated Interface IDs</b>
          </p>
          <p>Depending upon the operating system, a device may use a randomly generated Interface ID instead of using the MAC address and the EUI-64 process. For example, beginning with Windows Vista, Windows uses a randomly generated Interface ID instead of one created with EUI-64. Windows XP and previous Windows operating systems used EUI-64.</p>
          <p>After the Interface ID is established, either through the EUI-64 process or through random generation, it can be combined with an IPv6 prefix in the RA message to create a global unicast address, as shown in Figure 4. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: To ensure the uniqueness of any IPv6 unicast address, the client may use a process known as Duplicate Address Detection (DAD). This is similar to an ARP request for its own address. If there isn’t a reply, then the address is unique.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows an example of EUI-64. A computer uses the IPv6 global unicast of the router to construct its own global unicast  address. The computer uses the prefix from the router's address, which is 2001:DB8:ACAD:1 in the example. And then the computer uses EUI-64 to fill in the interface ID portion of the address. Figure 2 shows the E.U.I.-64 process for creating a 64 bit interface ID.  Step one begins with the example MAC address, FC:99:47:75:CE:E0.  The MAC address is split between the OUI and the device ID, and converted into binary.  In step two, the hexadecimal value FFFE is inserted between the OUI and the device ID. This makes converts the 48 bit MAC address into 64 bits.  In step three, the seventh high order bit is flipped from 0 to 1.  The modified MAC address is now the EUI-64 interface ID, FE:00:47:FF:FE:75:CE:E0. Figure 3 shows the Windows command line with the command "ipconfig" entered. The IPv6 global unicast address was generated using EUI-64. Figure 4 shows the Windows command line with the command "ipconfig" entered. The IPv6 global unicast address was created by generating a random 64-bit number for the interface ID.</div>
