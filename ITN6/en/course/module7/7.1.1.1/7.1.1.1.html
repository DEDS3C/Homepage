        <h1>IPv4 Addresses</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Binary is a numbering system that consists of the numbers 0 and 1 called <i>bits</i>. In contrast, the decimal numbering system consists of 10 digits consisting of the numbers 0 â€“ 9. </p>
          <p>Binary is important for us to understand because hosts, servers, and network devices use binary addressing. Specifically, they use binary IPv4 addresses, as shown in Figure 1, to identify each other. </p>
          <p>Each address consists of a string of 32 bits, divided into four sections called <i>octets</i>. Each octet contains 8 bits (or 1 byte) separated with a dot. For example, PC1 in the figure is assigned IPv4 address 11000000.10101000.00001010.00001010. Its default gateway address would be that of R1 Gigabit Ethernet interface 11000000.10101000.00001010.00000001. </p>
          <p>Working with binary numbers can be challenging. For ease of use by people, IPv4 addresses are commonly expressed in dotted decimal notation as shown in Figure 2. PC1 is assigned IPv4 address 192.168.10.10, and its default gateway address is 192.168.10.1. </p>
          <p>Figure 3 contrasts the dotted decimal address and 32-bit binary address of PC1.</p>
          <p>For a solid understanding of network addressing, it is necessary to know binary addressing and gain practical skills converting between binary and dotted decimal IPv4 addresses.</p>
          <p>This section will cover how to convert between base two and base 10 numbering systems. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows a topology with router connected to two LANs and to a cloud. Each LAN has a PC and there is a PC in the cloud. All the devices are labeled with their IP addresses in binary format, which is a series of 32 binary digits separated by a period at every 8th bit. Figure 2 shows the same topology as Figure 1. But now the devices are labeled with their IPv4 addresses in dotted decimal notation. Figure 3 shows the IP address 192.168.10.10 in dotted decimal format and in binary digits format.</div>
