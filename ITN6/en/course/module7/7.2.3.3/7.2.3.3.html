        <h1>IPv6 Unicast Addresses</h1>
        <div>
          <p>An IPv6 unicast address uniquely identifies an interface on an IPv6-enabled device. A packet sent to a unicast address is received by the interface that is assigned that address. Similar to IPv4, a source IPv6 address must be a unicast address. The destination IPv6 address can be either a unicast or a multicast address.</p>
          <p>The most common types of IPv6 unicast addresses are global unicast addresses (GUA) and link-local unicast addresses.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Global unicast</b>
          </p>
          <p>A global unicast address is similar to a public IPv4 address. These are globally unique, Internet routable addresses. Global unicast addresses can be configured statically or assigned dynamically. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Link-local</b>
          </p>
          <p>Link-local addresses are used to communicate with other devices on the same local link. With IPv6, the term link refers to a subnet. Link-local addresses are confined to a single link. Their uniqueness must only be confirmed on that link because they are not routable beyond the link. In other words, routers will not forward packets with a link-local source or destination address. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Unique local</b>
          </p>
          <p>Another type of unicast address is the unique local unicast address. IPv6 unique local addresses have some similarity to RFC 1918 private addresses for IPv4, but there are significant differences. Unique local addresses are used for local addressing within a site or between a limited number of sites. These addresses should not be routable in the global IPv6 and should not be translated to a global IPv6 address. Unique local addresses are in the range of FC00::/7 to FDFF::/7. </p>
          <p>With IPv4, private addresses are combined with NAT/PAT to provide a many-to-one translation of private-to-public addresses. This is done because of the limited availability of IPv4 address space. Many sites also use the private nature of RFC 1918 addresses to help secure or hide their network from potential security risks. However, this was never the intended use of these technologies, and the IETF has always recommended that sites take the proper security precautions on their Internet-facing router. Unique local addresses can be used for devices that will never need or have access from another network. </p>
