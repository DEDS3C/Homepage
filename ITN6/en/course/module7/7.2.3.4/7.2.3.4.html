        <h1>IPv6 Link-Local Unicast Addresses</h1>
        <div>
          <p>An IPv6 link-local address enables a device to communicate with other IPv6-enabled devices on the same link and only on that link (subnet). Packets with a source or destination link-local address cannot be routed beyond the link from which the packet originated.</p>
          <p>The global unicast address is not a requirement. However, every IPv6-enabled network interface is required to have a link-local address. </p>
          <p>If a link-local address is not configured manually on an interface, the device will automatically create its own without communicating with a DHCP server. IPv6-enabled hosts create an IPv6 link-local address even if the device has not been assigned a global unicast IPv6 address. This allows IPv6-enabled devices to communicate with other IPv6-enabled devices on the same subnet. This includes communication with the default gateway (router). </p>
          <p>IPv6 link-local addresses are in the FE80::/10 range. The /10 indicates that the first 10 bits are 1111 1110 10xx xxxx. The first hextet has a range of 1111 1110 10<b>00 0000</b> (FE80) to 1111 1110 10<b>11 1111</b> (FEBF). </p>
          <p>Figure 1 shows an example of communication using IPv6 link-local addresses.</p>
          <p>Figure 2 shows some of the uses for IPv6 link-local addresses.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Typically, it is the link-local address of the router, and not the global unicast address, that is used as the default gateway for other devices on the link. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows a router with a switch connected. The router also has two other networks attached. The router is configured with the same FE80::1/64 IPv6 link-local address on all three interfaces. On one of the LANs, there are two computers, a server, and a printer attached to the switch.  A computer is using link-local source and destination addresses to send a job to the printer. The router would not forward this job to another LAN because link-local addresses is local to the link. Figure 2 show a router connected to another router. One of the routers has a PC connected. The two routers are using the link-local address to send routing updates. The PC is using the router's link-local address as its default gateway.</div>
