        <h1>Broadcast Transmission</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Broadcast traffic is used to send packets to all hosts in the network using the broadcast address for the network. With a broadcast, the packet contains a destination IPv4 address with all ones (1s) in the host portion. This means that all hosts on that local network (broadcast domain) will receive and look at the packet. Many network protocols, such as DHCP, use broadcasts. When a host receives a packet sent to the network broadcast address, the host processes the packet as it would a packet addressed to its unicast address. </p>
          <p>Broadcast may be directed or limited. A directed broadcast is sent to all hosts on a specific network. For example, a host on the 172.16.4.0/24 network sends a packet to 172.16.4.255. A limited broadcast is sent to 255.255.255.255. By default, routers do not forward broadcasts. </p>
          <p>As an example, a host within the 172.16.4.0/24 network would broadcast to all hosts in its network using a packet with a destination address of 255.255.255.255.</p>
          <p>Play the animation to see an example of a limited broadcast transmission.</p>
          <p>When a packet is broadcast, it uses resources on the network and causes every receiving host on the network to process the packet. Therefore, broadcast traffic should be limited so that it does not adversely affect the performance of the network or devices. Because routers separate broadcast domains, subdividing networks can improve network performance by eliminating excessive broadcast traffic.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure is an animation showing a broadcast transmission.  A PC with the IP address 172.16.4.1 is sending a broadcast message to all the other devices.  The switch receives the frame and sends it out all other ports except for the port from which it received the frame. .</div>
