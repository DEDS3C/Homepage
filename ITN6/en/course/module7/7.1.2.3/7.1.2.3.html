        <h1>Logical AND</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A logical AND is one of three basic binary operations used in digital logic. The other two are OR and NOT. While all three are used in data networks, only AND is used in determining the network address. Therefore, our discussion here will be limited to the logical AND operation. </p>
          <p>Logical AND is the comparison of two bits that produce the results shown in Figure 1. Note how only a 1 AND 1 produces a 1.</p>
          <p>To identify the network address of an IPv4 host, the IPv4 address is logically ANDed, bit by bit, with the subnet mask. ANDing between the address and the subnet mask yields the network address. </p>
          <p>To illustrate how AND is used to discover a network address, consider a host with IPv4 address 192.168.10.10 and subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. Figure 2 displays the host IPv4 address and converted binary address. The host subnet mask binary address is added in Figure 3. </p>
          <p>The yellow highlighted sections in Figure 4 identify the AND bits that produced a binary 1 in the AND Results row. All other bit comparison produced binary 0s. Notice how the last octet no longer has any binary 1 bits. </p>
          <p>Finally, Figure 5 displays the resulting network address 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0. Therefore, host 192.168.10.10 is on network 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows the logical AND operation where 1 and 1 equal 1 and all other possibilities equal zero. Figure 2 shows the dotted decimal and binary formats for the IP address 192.168.10.10. Figure 3 adds the dotted decimal and binary formats for the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 to Figure 2. Figure 4 shows the ANDing operation between the binary format of the IP address and the binary format of the subnet mask. Figure 5 shows the result of the ANDing operation is the network address, 192.168.10.0</div>
