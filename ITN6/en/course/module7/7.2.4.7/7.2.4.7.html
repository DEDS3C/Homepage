        <h1>Static Link-Local Addresses</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Configuring the link-local address manually provides the ability to create an address that is recognizable and easier to remember. Typically, it is only necessary to create recognizable link-local addresses on routers. This is beneficial because router link-local addresses are used as default gateway addresses and in routing advertisement messages.</p>
          <p>Link-local addresses can be configured manually using the same interface command used to create IPv6 global unicast addresses but with the additional <b>link-local</b> parameter. When an address begins with this hextet within the range of FE80 to FEBF, the link-local parameter must follow the address.</p>
          <p>The figure shows the configuration of a link-local address using the <b>ipv6 address</b> interface command. The link-local address FE80::1 is used to make it easily recognizable as belonging to router R1. The same IPv6 link-local address is configured on all of R1’s interfaces. FE80::1 can be configured on each link because it only has to be unique on that link.</p>
          <p>Similar to R1, router R2 would be configured with FE80::2 as the IPv6 link-local address on all of its interfaces.</p>
