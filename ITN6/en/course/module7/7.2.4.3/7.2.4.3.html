        <h1>Dynamic Configuration - SLAAC</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) is a method that allows a device to obtain its prefix, prefix length, default gateway address, and other information from an <i>IPv6 router</i> without the use of a DHCPv6 server. Using SLAAC, devices rely on the local router’s ICMPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) messages to obtain the necessary information.</p>
          <p>IPv6 routers periodically send out ICMPv6 RA messages, every 200 seconds, to all IPv6-enabled devices on the network. An RA message will also be sent in response to a host sending an ICMPv6 Router Solicitation (RS) message.</p>
          <p>IPv6 routing is not enabled by default. To enable a router as an IPv6 router, the <b>ipv6 unicast-routing</b> global configuration command must be used. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: IPv6 addresses can be configured on a router without it being an IPv6 router.</p>
          <p>The ICMPv6 RA message is a suggestion to a device on how to obtain an IPv6 global unicast address. The ultimate decision is up to the device’s operating system. The ICMPv6 RA message includes:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Network prefix and prefix length</b> – Tells the device which network it belongs to.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Default gateway address</b> – This is an IPv6 link-local address, the source IPv6 address of the RA message.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>DNS addresses and domain name</b> – Addresses of DNS servers and a domain name.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>As shown in Figure 1, there are three options for RA messages:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Option 1: SLAAC</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Option 2: SLAAC with a stateless DHCPv6 server</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Option 3: Stateful DHCPv6 (no SLAAC)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>RA Option 1: SLAAC</b>
          </p>
          <p>By default, the RA message suggests that the receiving device use the information in the RA message to create its own IPv6 global unicast address and for all other information. The services of a DHCPv6 server are not required. </p>
          <p>SLAAC is stateless, which means there is no central server (for example, a stateful DHCPv6 server) allocating global unicast addresses and keeping a list of devices and their addresses. With SLAAC, the client device uses the information in the RA message to create its own global unicast address. As shown in Figure 2, the two parts of the address are created as follows:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Prefix</b> – Received in the RA message</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Interface ID</b> – Uses the EUI-64 process or by generating a random 64-bit number</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows the router solicitation process by displaying a computer sending a request for IPv6 addressing information from all IPv6 routers.  The figure also shows a router advertisement message being sent by a router.  This message can have one of three options configured, option one gives all the necessary addressing information, option two sets some addressing options but relies on a DHCPv6 server for some settings, and option three relies solely on a DHCPv6 server for all addressing information.  The router advertisement in the figure is using option one and it is telling the computer the prefix, prefix-length, and default gateway to use. Figure 2 shows an example of SLAAC. A computer uses the IPv6 global unicast of the router to construct its own global unicast  address. The computer uses the prefix from the router's address, which is 2001:DB8:ACAD:1 in the example. And then the computer either uses EUI-64 or generates a random 64-bit number to fill in the interface ID portion of the address.</div>
