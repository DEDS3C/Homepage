        <h1>Duplex and Speed Settings</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Two of the most basic settings on a switch are the bandwidth and duplex settings for each individual switch port. It is critical that the duplex and bandwidth settings match between the switch port and the connected devices, such as a computer or another switch. </p>
          <p>There are two types of duplex settings used for communications on an Ethernet network: half duplex and full duplex.</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Full-duplex</b> – Both ends of the connection can send and receive simultaneously. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Half-duplex</b> – Only one end of the connection can send at a time. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Autonegotiation is an optional function found on most Ethernet switches and NICs. Autonegotiation enables two devices to automatically exchange information about speed and duplex capabilities. The switch and the connected device will choose the highest performance mode. Full-duplex is chosen if both devices have the capability along with their highest common bandwidth.</p>
          <p>For example, in Figure 1 PC-A’s Ethernet NIC can operate in full-duplex or half-duplex, and in 10 Mb/s or 100 Mb/s. PC-A is connected to switch S1 on port 1, which can operate in full-duplex or half-duplex, and in 10 Mb/s, 100 Mb/s or 1000 Mb/s (1 Gb/s). If both devices are using autonegotiation, the operating mode will be full-duplex and 100 Mb/s.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Most Cisco switches and Ethernet NICs default to autonegotiation for speed and duplex. Gigabit Ethernet ports only operate in full-duplex.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Duplex Mismatch</b>
          </p>
          <p>One of the most common causes of performance issues on 10/100 Mb/s Ethernet links occurs when one port on the link operates at half-duplex while the other port operates at full-duplex, as shown in Figure 2. This occurs when one or both ports on a link are reset, and the autonegotiation process does not result in both link partners having the same configuration. It also can occur when users reconfigure one side of a link and forget to reconfigure the other. Both sides of a link should have autonegotiation on, or both sides should have it off.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows a PC connected to a switch. The two devices have autonegotiated to operate at full duplex and at 100 Mb/s. Figure 2 shows a PC connected to a switch. The PC is operating at full duplex but the switch is operating at half-duplex and is getting collisions.</div>
