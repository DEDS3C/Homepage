        <h1>Broadcast MAC Address</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A broadcast packet contains a destination IPv4 address that has all ones (1s) in the host portion. This numbering in the address means that all hosts on that local network (broadcast domain) will receive and process the packet. Many network protocols, such as DHCP and ARP, use broadcasts. </p>
          <p>As shown in the animation, the source host sends an IPv4 broadcast packet to all devices on its network. The IPv4 destination address is a broadcast address, 192.168.1.255. When the IPv4 broadcast packet is encapsulated in the Ethernet frame, the destination MAC address is the broadcast MAC address of FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF in hexadecimal (48 ones in binary). </p>

      <div id="media-description">This animation shows several computers connected to a switch.  Host 1 wants to send a packet to all other hosts (a broadcast).  The diagram shows the MAC address and IP address of host 1.  The graphic also shows the frame with source and destination MAC address and the encapsulated packet with source and destination IP address.  The destination MAC address is formed by all Fs (the broadcast MAC address).  When the animation plays, the frame travels from host 1 to all other hosts connected to the switch.</div>
