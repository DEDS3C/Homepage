        <h1>Destination Remote Network</h1>
        <div>
          <p>When the destination IP address is on a remote network, the destination MAC address will be the address of the host’s default gateway, the router’s NIC, as shown in the figure. Using a postal analogy, this would be similar to a person taking a letter to their local post office. All they need to do is take the letter to the post office and then it becomes the responsibility of the post office to forward the letter on towards its final destination.</p>
          <p>The figure shows the Ethernet MAC addresses and IPv4 addresses for PC-A sending an IP packet to a web server on a remote network. Routers examine the destination IPv4 address to determine the best path to forward the IPv4 packet. This is similar to how the postal service forwards mail based on the address of the recipient. </p>
          <p>When the router receives the Ethernet frame, it de-encapsulates the Layer 2 information. Using the destination IP address, it determines the next-hop device, and then encapsulates the IP packet in a new data link frame for the outgoing interface. Along each link in a path, an IP packet is encapsulated in a frame specific to the particular data link technology associated with that link, such as Ethernet. If the next-hop device is the final destination, the destination MAC address will be that of the device’s Ethernet NIC.  </p>
          <p>How are the IPv4 addresses of the IPv4 packets in a data flow associated with the MAC addresses on each link along the path to the destination? This is done through a process called Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows PC A connected to router 1, which is connected to R2. R2 is connected to a file server. PC A is sending data to the file server. PC A builds a packet with its own IP address as the source and the destination IP address of the file server. PC A then builds a frame with its own MAC address as the source and the MAC address for R1 as the destination.</div>
