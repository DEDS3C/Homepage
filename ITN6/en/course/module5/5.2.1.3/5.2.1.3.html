        <h1>Filtering Frames</h1>
        <div>
          <p>As a switch receives frames from different devices, it is able to populate its MAC address table by examining the source MAC address of every frame. When the switch’s MAC address table contains the destination MAC address, it is able to filter the frame and forward out a single port.</p>
          <p>Figures 1 and 2 show PC-D sending a frame back to PC-A. The switch will first learn PC-D’s MAC address. Next, because the switch has PC-A’s MAC address in its table, it will send the frame only out port 1. </p>
          <p>Figure 3 shows PC-A sending another frame to PC-D. The MAC address table already contains PC-A’s MAC address, so the five-minute refresh timer for that entry is reset. Next, because the switch’s table contains PC-D’s MAC address, it sends the frame only out port 4.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows a four port switch with four PCs attached one to each port. The PCs are named A, B, C, and D. The abbreviated MAC addresses are 00-0A, 00-0B, 00-0C, and 00-0D. The switch MAC address table is also shown. The MAC table includes port and MAC address for A. The switch received a frame from D and entered the port number and MAC address for D. In Figure 2, the switch forwards the frame out the port associated with A. In Figure 3, A sends another frame to D and the switch only forwards the frame out the port associated with D.</div>
