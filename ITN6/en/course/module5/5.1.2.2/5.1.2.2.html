        <h1>MAC Address: Ethernet Identity</h1>
        <div>
          <p>In Ethernet, every network device is connected to the same, shared media. Ethernet was once predominantly a half-duplex topology using a multi-access bus or later Ethernet hubs. This meant that all nodes would receive every frame transmitted. To prevent the excessive overhead involved in the processing of every frame, MAC addresses were created to identify the actual source and destination. MAC addressing provides a method for device identification at the lower level of the OSI model. Although Ethernet has now transitioned to full-duplex NICs and switches, it is still possible that a device that is not the intended destination will receive an Ethernet frame.</p>
          <p>
            <b>MAC Address Structure</b>
          </p>
          <p>The MAC address value is a direct result of IEEE-enforced rules for vendors to ensure globally unique addresses for each Ethernet device. The rules established by IEEE require any vendor that sells Ethernet devices to register with IEEE. The IEEE assigns the vendor a 3-byte (24-bit) code, called the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI). </p>
          <p>IEEE requires a vendor to follow two simple rules, as shown in the figure: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>All MAC addresses assigned to a NIC or other Ethernet device must use that vendor's assigned OUI as the first 3 bytes.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>All MAC addresses with the same OUI must be assigned a unique value in the last 3 bytes. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: It is possible for duplicate MAC addresses to exist due to mistakes during manufacturing or in some virtual machine implementation methods. In either case, it will be necessary to modify the MAC address with a new NIC or in software.</p>
