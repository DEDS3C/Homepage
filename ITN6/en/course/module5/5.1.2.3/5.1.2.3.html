        <h1>Frame Processing</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The MAC address is often referred to as a burned-in address (BIA) because, historically, this address is burned into ROM (Read-Only Memory) on the NIC. This means that the address is encoded into the ROM chip permanently. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: On modern PC operating systems and NICs, it is possible to change the MAC address in software. This is useful when attempting to gain access to a network that filters based on BIA. Consequently, filtering or controlling traffic based on the MAC address is no longer as secure. </p>
          <p>When the computer starts up, the first thing the NIC does is copy the MAC address from ROM into RAM. When a device is forwarding a message to an Ethernet network, it attaches header information to the frame. The header information contains the source and destination MAC address.</p>
          <p>Click Play in the animation to view the frame forwarding process. When a NIC receives an Ethernet frame, it examines the destination MAC address to see if it matches the deviceâ€™s physical MAC address stored in RAM. If there is no match, the device discards the frame. If there is a match, it passes the frame up the OSI layers, where the de-encapsulation process takes place.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Note:</b> Ethernet NICs will also accept frames if the destination MAC address is a broadcast or a multicast group of which the host is a member.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Any device that can be the source or destination of an Ethernet frame must be assigned a MAC address. This includes workstations, servers, printers, mobile devices, and routers.</p>

      <div id="media-description">This animation shows how a frame is forwarded.  There are four computers on shared media.  Each has a different MAC address.  Computer 1 sends a frame to Computer 3 using the correct MAC addresses for source and destination.  The frame is forwarded to all of the computers.  Computers 2 and 4 ignore the frame since the destination MAC address does not match their own.</div>
