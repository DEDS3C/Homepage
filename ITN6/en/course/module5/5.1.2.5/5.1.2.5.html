        <h1>Unicast MAC Address</h1>
        <div>
          <p>In Ethernet, different MAC addresses are used for Layer 2 unicast, broadcast, and multicast communications.</p>
          <p>A unicast MAC address is the unique address used when a frame is sent from a single transmitting device to a single destination device.</p>
          <p>In the example shown in the animation, a host with IPv4 address 192.168.1.5 (source) requests a web page from the server at IPv4 unicast address 192.168.1.200. For a unicast packet to be sent and received, a destination IP address must be in the IP packet header. A corresponding destination MAC address must also be present in the Ethernet frame header. The IP address and MAC address combine to deliver data to one specific destination host.</p>
          <p>The process that a source host uses to determine the destination MAC address is known as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). ARP is discussed later in this chapter.</p>
          <p>Although the destination MAC address can be a unicast, broadcast, or multicast address, the source MAC address must always be a unicast.</p>

      <div id="media-description">This animation shows several computers connected to a switch.  Host 1 wants to send a packet to a server (a unicast).  The diagram shows the MAC address and IP address of both host 1 and the server.  The graphic also shows the frame with source and destination MAC address and the encapsulated packet with source and destination IP address.  When the animation plays, the frame travels from host 1 to the server since the switch forwards the frame based on MAC address and knows where the server is located.</div>
