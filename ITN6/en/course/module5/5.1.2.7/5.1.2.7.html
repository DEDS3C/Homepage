        <h1>Multicast MAC Address</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Multicast addresses allow a source device to send a packet to a group of devices. Devices that belong to a multicast group are assigned a multicast group IP address. The range of IPv4 multicast addresses is 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255. The range of IPv6 multicast addresses begin with FF00::/8. Because multicast addresses represent a group of addresses (sometimes called a host group), they can only be used as the destination of a packet. The source will always be a unicast address. </p>
          <p>Multicast addresses would be used in remote gaming, where many players are connected remotely but playing the same game. Another use of multicast addresses is in distance learning through video conferencing, where many students are connected to the same class. </p>
          <p>As with the unicast and broadcast addresses, the multicast IP address requires a corresponding multicast MAC address to actually deliver frames on a local network. The multicast MAC address associated with an IPv4 multicast address is a special value that begins with 01-00-5E in hexadecimal. The remaining portion of the multicast MAC address is created by converting the lower 23 bits of the IP multicast group address into 6 hexadecimal characters. For an IPv6 address, the multicast MAC address begins with 33-33.</p>
          <p>An example, as shown in the animation, is the multicast hexadecimal address 01-00-5E-00-00-C8. The last byte, or eight bits, of the IPv4 address 224.0.0.200, is the decimal value 200. The easiest way to see the hexadecimal equivalent is to first convert it to binary with a space between each four bits, 200 (decimal) = 1100 1000 (binary). Using the binary to hexadecimal conversion chart shown earlier, 1100 1000 (binary) = 0xC8. </p>

      <div id="media-description">This animation shows several computers connected to a switch.  Host one wants to send a packet to a group of computers (a multicast).  The diagram shows the MAC address and IP address of host 1.  The graphic also shows the frame with source and destination MAC address and the encapsulated packet with source and destination IP address.  The destination IP address is a multicast address (224.0.0.200) and the destination MAC address is special.  It starts with 01-00-5E and ends with the hexadecimal equivalent of the last three octets of the IP multicast address, 00-00-C8.  When the animation plays, the frame travels from host 1 to the selected hosts that are listening to the multicast address.</div>
