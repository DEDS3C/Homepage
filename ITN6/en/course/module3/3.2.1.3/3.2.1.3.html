        <h1>Protocol Interaction</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Communication between a web server and web client is an example of an interaction between several protocols. The protocols shown in the figure include:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>HTTP -</b> is an application protocol that governs the way a web server and a web client interact. HTTP defines the content and formatting of the requests and responses that are exchanged between the client and server. Both the client and the web server software implement HTTP as part of the application. HTTP relies on other protocols to govern how the messages are transported between the client and server.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>TCP</b> - is the transport protocol that manages the individual conversations. TCP divides the HTTP messages into smaller pieces, called segments. These segments are sent between the web server and client processes running at the destination host. TCP is also responsible for controlling the size and rate at which messages are exchanged between the server and the client. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>IP -</b> is responsible for taking the formatted segments from TCP, encapsulating them into packets, assigning them the appropriate addresses, and delivering them to the destination host.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Ethernet </b>- is a network access protocol that describes two primary functions: communication over a data link and the physical transmission of data on the network media. Network access protocols are responsible for taking the packets from IP and formatting them to be transmitted over the media.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows the protocol stack interaction during a web server and a web client communication.  This communication begins with the hypertext transport protocol (HTTP), it is then passed to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), from here it is passed to the Internet Protocol (IP) layer, and lastly it is passed to a network access protocol such as Ethernet.</div>
