        <h1>Electronics and Communications Standard Organizations</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Other standard organizations have responsibilities for promoting and creating the electronic and communication standards used to deliver the IP packets as electronic signals over a wired or wireless medium. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers </b>(<b>IEEE</b>, pronounced “I-triple-E”) – Organization of electrical engineering and electronics dedicated to advancing technological innovation and creating standards in a wide area of industries including power and energy, healthcare, telecommunications, and networking. Figure 1 shows several of the standards related to networking. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) </b>- Best known for its standards related to electrical wiring, connectors, and the 19-inch racks used to mount networking equipment. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) </b>- Responsible for developing communication standards in a variety of areas including radio equipment, cellular towers, Voice over IP (VoIP) devices, satellite communications, and more. Figure 2 shows an example of an Ethernet cable meeting TIA/EIA standards.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>International Telecommunications Union-Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T</b>) - One of the largest and oldest communication standard organizations. The ITU-T defines standards for video compression, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), and broadband communications, such as a digital subscriber line (DSL).</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 lists all the IEEE 802 working groups and study groups. Of particular interest to the learner is the 802.1 Higher Layer LAN Protocols Working Group, the 802.3 Ethernet Working Group, and the 802.11 Wireless LAN Working Group. Figure 2 shows a CAT5E cable that has been marked as verified to conform with the TIA/EIA 568B standard.</div>
