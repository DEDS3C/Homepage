        <h1>The TCP/IP Protocol Model</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The TCP/IP protocol model for internetwork communications was created in the early 1970s and is sometimes referred to as the Internet model. As shown in the figure, it defines four categories of functions that must occur for communications to be successful. The architecture of the TCP/IP protocol suite follows the structure of this model. Because of this, the Internet model is commonly referred to as the TCP/IP model.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Most protocol models describe a vendor-specific protocol stack. Legacy protocol suites, such as Novell Netware and AppleTalk, are examples of vendor-specific protocol stacks. Because the TCP/IP model is an open standard, one company does not control the definition of the model. The definitions of the standard and the TCP/IP protocols are discussed in a public forum and defined in a publicly available set of RFCs.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure lists the four layers of the TCP/IP. model and a brief description of what each layer provides.  The layers from top down are as follows:  The Application layer represents data to the user, plus encoding and dialog control.  Transport layer supports communication between diverse devices across diverse networks.  The Internetwork layer determines the best path through the network.  The Network Interface layer controls the hardware devices and media that make up the network.</div>
