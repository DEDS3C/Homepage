        <h1>Rule Establishment</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Before communicating with one another, individuals must use established rules or agreements to govern the conversation. For example, consider Figure 1, protocols are necessary for effective communication. These rules, or protocols, must be followed in order for the message to be successfully delivered and understood. Protocols must account for the following requirements:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>An identified sender and receiver</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Common language and grammar</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Speed and timing of delivery</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Confirmation or acknowledgment requirements </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The protocols that are used in network communications share many of these fundamental traits. In addition to identifying the source and destination, computer and network protocols define the details of how a message is transmitted across a network. Common computer protocols include the requirements shown in Figure 2. Each of these will be discussed in more detail.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 has two sentences used to represent the importance of establishing rules for communication.  The first sentence is a long sentence that does not have any spaces between the words, which makes it difficult to read.  A second sentence is written in Spanish, and could be hard to understand if the receiver doesnâ€™t speak the language.  There is a Translate button that the learner can select that will add the spaces between the words and also translate form Spanish to English. Figure 2 is a star diagram that has Protocols as the central word and the branches are characteristics of protocols.  These characteristics include message encoding, message formatting and encapsulation, message size, message timing and message delivery options.</div>
