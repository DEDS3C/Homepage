        <h1>Data Link Addresses</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The data link, or Layer 2, physical address has a different role. The purpose of the data link address is to deliver the data link frame from one network interface to another network interface on the same network. This process is illustrated in Figures 1 through 3.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Before an IP packet can be sent over a wired or wireless network, it must be encapsulated in a data link frame so it can be transmitted over the physical medium. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As the IP packet travels from host-to-router, router-to-router, and finally router-to-host, at each point along the way the IP packet is encapsulated in a new data link frame. Each data link frame contains the source data link address of the NIC card sending the frame, and the destination data link address of the NIC card receiving the frame. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Layer 2, data link protocol is only used to deliver the packet from NIC-to-NIC on the same network. The router removes the Layer 2 information as it is received on one NIC and adds new data link information before forwarding out the exit NIC on its way towards the final destination.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The IP packet is encapsulated in a data link frame that contains data link information, including a:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Source data link address</b> - The physical address of the deviceâ€™s NIC that is sending the data link frame. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Destination data link address</b> - The physical address of the NIC that is receiving the data link frame. This address is either the next hop router or of the final destination device. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The data link frame also contains a trailer which will be discussed in later chapters.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figures 1, 2, and 3 demonstrate the concept that layer 2 address change at every hop while the layer 3 addresses stay the same. In Figure 1, the layer 2 addresses are for the original source and router 1. In Figure 2, the layer 2 addresses are for router 1 and router 2. In Figure 3, the layer 2 addresses are for router 2 and the final destination, the web server.</div>
