        <h1>Network Protocols</h1>
        <div>
          <p>At the human level, some communication rules are formal and others are simply understood based on custom and practice. For devices to successfully communicate, a network protocol suite must describe precise requirements and interactions. Networking protocols define a common format and set of rules for exchanging messages between devices. Some common networking protocols are Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and Internet Protocol (IP). </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: IP in this course refers to both the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. IPv6 is the most recent version of IP and the replacement for the more common IPv4.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The figures illustrate networking protocols that describe the following processes:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>How the message is formatted or structured, as shown in Figure 1.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The process by which networking devices share information about pathways with other networks, as shown in Figure 2.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>How and when error and system messages are passed between devices, as shown in Figure 3.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The setup and termination of data transfer sessions, as shown in Figure 4.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure one shows the role of protocols in data transfer.  The role here is to forward data packets across a network.  The example shows a router reading a message because it understands the I P version four header and therefore can process it. Figure two shows routers sharing information about pathways to other networks.  It is common for routers to share information. Figure three shows routers communicating with each other regarding a slow path due to another path that is down, this sharing of information is critical to a network. Figure four shows the setup and termination of a data transfer session between a host and a server.</div>
