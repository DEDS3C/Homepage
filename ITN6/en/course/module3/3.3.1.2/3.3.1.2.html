        <h1>Protocol Data Units</h1>
        <div>
          <p>As application data is passed down the protocol stack on its way to be transmitted across the network media, various protocol information is added at each level. This is known as the encapsulation process. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The form that a piece of data takes at any layer is called a protocol data unit (PDU). During encapsulation, each succeeding layer encapsulates the PDU that it receives from the layer above in accordance with the protocol being used. At each stage of the process, a PDU has a different name to reflect its new functions. Although there is no universal naming convention for PDUs, in this course, the PDUs are named according to the protocols of the TCP/IP suite, as shown in the figure. Click each PDU in the figure for more information.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows the data encapsulation process as a message is passed down the protocol stack.  The example is an e-mail and it starts as data at layer seven.  The PDU is a segment when it acquires the transport layer header, then it becomes a packet when it receives the network header.  When the frame header and trailer are added the PDU becomes a frame.  As it moves to transmission across the medium it is in bits.  </div>
