        <h1>The Benefits of Using a Layered Model</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The benefits to using a layered model to describe network protocols and operations include:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Assisting in protocol design because protocols that operate at a specific layer have defined information that they act upon and a defined interface to the layers above and below. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Fostering competition because products from different vendors can work together. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Preventing technology or capability changes in one layer from affecting other layers above and below. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Providing a common language to describe networking functions and capabilities.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>As shown in the figure, the TCP/IP model and the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model are the primary models used when discussing network functionality. They each represent a basic type of layered networking models: </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Protocol model</b> - This type of model closely matches the structure of a particular protocol suite. The TCP/IP model is a protocol model because it describes the functions that occur at each layer of protocols within the TCP/IP suite. TCP/IP is also used as a reference model.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Reference model</b> - This type of model provides consistency within all types of network protocols and services by describing what has to be done at a particular layer, but not prescribing how it should be accomplished. The OSI model is a widely known internetwork reference model, but is also a protocol model for the OSI protocol suite. </li>
            </ul>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows the two networking models side by side, the seven layer OSI model and the four layer TCP/IP model. The main TCP/IP suite protocols are listed for each of the layers.  The application, presentation and session layers of the OSI. model line up with the Application layer of TCP/IP. model, and here are HTTP, DNS, DHCP, and FTP.  The Transport layers align together and carry TCP and UDP.  The OSI network layer aligns with the Internet layer of TCP/IP and carries both IP version 4 and version 6 along with ICMP for both versions 4 and 6.  The OSI data link and physical align with the TCP/IP network access layer and some of the protocols here are PPP, Frame Relay and Ethernet.</div>
