        <h1>Message Timing</h1>
        <div>
          <p>These are the rules of engagement for message timing.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Access Method</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Access method determines when someone is able to send a message. If two people talk at the same time, a collision of information occurs and it is necessary for the two to back off and start again, as shown in the animation. Likewise, it is necessary for computers to define an access method. Hosts on a network need an access method to know when to begin sending messages and how to respond when collisions occur. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Flow Control</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Timing also affects how much information can be sent and the speed that it can be delivered. If one person speaks too quickly, it is difficult for the other person to hear and understand the message. In network communication, source and destination hosts use flow control methods to negotiate correct timing for successful communication. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Response Timeout</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If a person asks a question and does not hear a response within an acceptable amount of time, the person assumes that no answer is coming and reacts accordingly. The person may repeat the question, or may go on with the conversation. Hosts on the network also have rules that specify how long to wait for responses and what action to take if a response timeout occurs.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows a woman calling a man on the phone and each is asking the other a question at the same time.  Neither one can understand the other.  This represents access method. Figure 2 shows the woman asking if the man can hear her, and the man doesnâ€™t answer because he cannot understand the woman.  This represents the need for flow control. Figure 3 shows the man not answering her, so she repeats the question.  This is representing the response timeout of a communication.</div>
