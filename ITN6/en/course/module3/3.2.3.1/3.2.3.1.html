        <h1>Open Standards</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Open standards encourage interoperability, competition, and innovation. They also guarantee that no single company’s product can monopolize the market, or have an unfair advantage over its competition. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A good example of this is when purchasing a wireless router for the home. There are many different choices available from a variety of vendors, all of which incorporate standard protocols such as IPv4, DHCP, 802.3 (Ethernet), and 802.11 (Wireless LAN). These open standards also allow a client running Apple’s OS X operating system to download a web page from a web server running the Linux operating system. This is because both operating systems implement the open standard protocols, such as those in the TCP/IP protocol suite.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Standards organizations are important in maintaining an open Internet with freely accessible specifications and protocols that can be implemented by any vendor. A standards organization may draft a set of rules entirely on its own or in other cases may select a proprietary protocol as the basis for the standard. If a proprietary protocol is used, it usually involves the vendor who created the protocol. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Standards organizations are usually vendor-neutral, non-profit organizations established to develop and promote the concept of open standards.</p>
