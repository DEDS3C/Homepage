        <h1>Message Size</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Another rule of communication is size. When people communicate with each other, the messages that they send are usually broken into smaller parts or sentences. These sentences are limited in size to what the receiving person can process at one time, as shown in Figure 1. An individual conversation may be made up of many smaller sentences to ensure that each part of the message is received and understood. Imagine what it would be like to read this course if it all appeared as one long sentence; it would not be easy to read and comprehend.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Likewise, when a long message is sent from one host to another over a network, it is necessary to break the message into smaller pieces, as shown in Figure 2. The rules that govern the size of the pieces, or frames, communicated across the network are very strict. They can also be different, depending on the channel used. Frames that are too long or too short are not delivered. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The size restrictions of frames require the source host to break a long message into individual pieces that meet both the minimum and maximum size requirements. The long message will be sent in separate frames, with each frame containing a piece of the original message.  Each frame will also have its own addressing information. At the receiving host, the individual pieces of the message are reconstructed into the original message.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 is an animation of the communication process between two people, specifically on the message size. A woman is thinking of a message, she formulates the message and transmits it to a man very quickly with no spacing between the words.  The man cannot process the information in this manner and has to ask for it to be re-sent in a slower and organized fashion.  The woman complies and this time the man can understand the information.  This represents segmenting of data. Figure 2 is an animation of the communication process between two computers. The data is sent from one computer to another very quickly and with no breaks, which the receiving computer cannot process.   The sending computer repeats sending data and the second time it segments the message, which can then be processed by the receiving computer.</div>
