        <h1>Introducing Teleworking</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Teleworking is working away from the traditional workplace, such as working from a home office. The reasons for choosing teleworking are varied and include everything from personal convenience to allowing sick or disabled employees the opportunity to continue working. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Teleworking is a broad term referring to conducting work by connecting to a workplace from a remote location, with the assistance of telecommunications. Efficient teleworking is possible because of broadband Internet connections, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), Voice over IP (VoIP), and videoconferencing. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Many modern enterprises are offering employment opportunities for people who cannot commute to work every day, or for whom working out of a home office is more practical. These people, called teleworkers, must connect to the company network so that they can work and share information from their home offices. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Broadband solutions are integral to successful teleworking. This chapter details the benefits of teleworking and how broadband solutions enable teleworking as a smarter way to do business.</p>
