        <h1>Teleworker Solution</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Organizations need secure, reliable, and cost-effective networks to connect corporate headquarters, branch offices, and suppliers. With the growing number of teleworkers, enterprises increasingly need secure, reliable, and cost-effective ways to connect teleworkers with the organizational resources on corporate LAN sites.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The figure illustrates the remote connection topologies that modern networks use to connect remote locations. In some cases, the remote locations only connect to the headquarters location, while in other cases, remote locations connect to multiple sites. The branch office in the figure connects to the headquarters and partner sites, while the teleworker has a single connection to the headquarters. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are three primary remote connection technologies available to organizations supporting teleworker services:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Broadband connections </b>- The broadband term refers to advanced communications systems capable of providing high-speed transmission of services, such as data, voice, and video, over the Internet and other networks. Transmission is provided by a wide range of technologies, including DSL, fiber-to-the-home, coaxial cable systems, wireless, and satellite. The broadband service data transmission speeds typically exceed 200 kb/s in at least one direction between the ISP and the user.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>IPsec VPNs </b>- This is the most common option for teleworkers, combined with remote access over broadband, to establish a secure VPN over the public Internet. This type of WAN connection offers flexible and scalable connectivity. Site-to-site connections can provide a secure, fast, and reliable remote connection to teleworkers. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Traditional private WAN Layer 2 technologies </b>- These types of connections provide many remote connection solutions and include technologies, such as Frame Relay, ATM, and leased lines. The security of these connections is dependent upon the service provider providing them.  </li>
            </ul>
