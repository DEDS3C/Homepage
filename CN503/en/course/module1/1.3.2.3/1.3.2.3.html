        <h1>Data Center and Virtualization</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The Cisco Data Center/Virtualization architecture is built upon Cisco Data Center 3.0. It comprises a comprehensive set of virtualization technologies and services that bring the network, computing, storage, and virtualization platforms together.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The data center architecture consists of three components, as shown in Figure 1:</p>
          <p>
