        <h1>Remote Functional Area </h1>
        <div>
          <p>The remote functional area is responsible for remote connectivity options and includes several modules:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Enterprise Branch </b>
          </p>
          <p>The enterprise branch module includes remote branches that allow employees to work at non-campus locations. These locations are typically responsible for providing security, telephony, and mobility options to employees, as well as general connectivity into the campus network and the different components located inside the enterprise campus. The enterprise branch module allows enterprises to extend head-office applications and services, such as security, Cisco Unified Communications, and advanced application performance, to the remote branches. The edge device connecting the remote site to the central site varies depending on the needs and size of the site. Large remote sites may use high-end Cisco Catalyst switches, while smaller sites may use an ISR G2 router. These remote sites rely on the SP edge to provide services and applications from the main site. In the figure the enterprise branch module connects to the enterprise campus site primarily using a WAN link; however, it also has an Internet link as a backup. The Internet link uses site-to-site IPsec VPN technology to encrypt corporate data.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Enterprise Teleworker</b>
          </p>
          <p>The enterprise teleworker module is responsible for providing connectivity for workers who operate out of different geographically dispersed locations, including home offices, hotels or customer/client sites. The teleworker module recommends that mobile users connect to the Internet using the services of a local ISP, such as cable modem or DSL. VPN services can then be used to secure communications between the mobile worker and central campus. Integrated security- and identity-based networking services enable the enterprise to extend campus security policies to the teleworker. Staff can securely log into the network over the VPN and gain access to authorized applications and services from a single cost-effective platform.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Enterprise Data Center </b>
          </p>
          <p>The enterprise data center module is a data center with all of the same functional options as a campus data center, but exists at a remote location. This provides an added layer of security as the offsite data center can provide disaster recovery and business continuance services for the enterprise. High-end switches such as the Cisco Nexus series switch use fast WAN services such as Metro Ethernet (MetroE) to connect the enterprise campus to the remote enterprise data center. Redundant data centers provide backup using synchronous and asynchronous data and application replication. Additionally, the network and devices offer server and application load balancing to maximize performance. This solution allows the enterprise to scale without major changes to the infrastructure. </p>
