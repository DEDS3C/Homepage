        <h1>Network Requirements</h1>
        <div>
          <p>When discussing network design, it is useful to categorize networks based on the number of devices serviced:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Small network </b>- Provides services for up to 200 devices.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Medium-sized network </b>- Provides services for 200 to 1000 devices.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Large network </b>- Provides services for 1000+ devices. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Network designs vary depending on the size and requirements of the organizations. For example, the networking infrastructure needs of a small organization with fewer devices will be less complex than the infrastructure of a large organization with a significant number of devices and connections. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are many variables to consider when designing a network. For instance, consider the example in the figure. The sample high-level topology diagram is for a large enterprise network that consists of a main campus site connecting small, medium, and large sites. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Network design is an expanding area and requires a great deal of knowledge and experience. The intent of this section is to introduce commonly accepted network design concepts.</p>
