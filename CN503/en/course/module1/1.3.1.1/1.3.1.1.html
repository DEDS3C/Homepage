        <h1>IT Challenges</h1>
        <div>
          <p>As businesses have grown more dependent on networks for success, network architectures have evolved over the years. Traditionally, users, data, and applications were housed on premise. Users could only access network resources with company-owned computers. The network had distinct borders and access requirements. Maintaining security, productivity, and services was simpler. Today, the network border has shifted, creating new challenges for IT departments. Networks are transforming from a data-only transportation system of connected LAN devices, to a system that enables the connections of people, devices, and information in a media rich, converged network environment.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As new technologies and end user devices come to market, businesses and consumers must continue to adjust to this ever-changing environment. There are several new networking trends that continue to effect organizations and consumers. Some of the top trends include:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Online collaboration</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Video communication</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Cloud computing</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>These trends, while allowing for more advanced services than ever before, also introduce new security risks that IT must address. </p>
