        <h1>Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)</h1>
        <div>
          <p>One of the many features of PPP is that it performs Layer 2 authentication in addition to other layers of authentication, encryption, access control, and general security procedures.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Initiating PAP</b>
          </p>
          <p>PAP provides a simple method for a remote node to establish its identity using a two-way handshake. PAP is not interactive. When the<span class="cmd"><b> ppp authentication pap </b></span>command is used, the username and password are sent as one LCP data package, rather than the server sending a login prompt and waiting for a response, as shown in Figure 1.  After PPP completes the link establishment phase, the remote node repeatedly sends a username-password pair across the link until the receiving node acknowledges it or terminates the connection.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Completing PAP</b>
          </p>
          <p>At the receiving node, the username-password is checked by an authentication server that either allows or denies the connection. An accept or reject message is returned to the requester, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>PAP is not a strong authentication protocol. Using PAP, passwords are sent across the link in plaintext and there is no protection from playback or repeated trial-and-error attacks. The remote node is in control of the frequency and timing of the login attempts.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Nonetheless, there are times when using PAP can be justified. For example, despite its shortcomings, PAP may be used in the following environments:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>A large installed base of client applications that do not support CHAP</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Incompatibilities between different vendor implementations of CHAP</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Situations where a plaintext password must be available to simulate a login at the remote host</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
