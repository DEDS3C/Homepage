        <h1>Types of Remote-access VPNs</h1>
        <div>
          <p>VPNs have become the logical solution for remote access connectivity for many reasons. VPNs provide secure communications with access rights tailored to individual users, such as employees, contractors, and partners. They also enhance productivity by extending the corporate network and applications securely while reducing communication costs and increasing flexibility. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Using VPN technology, employees can essentially take their office with them, including access to emails and network applications. VPNs can also allow contractors and partners to have limited access to the specific servers, web pages, or files required. This network access allows them to contribute to business productivity without compromising network security.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are two primary methods for deploying remote-access VPNs:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>IP Security (IPsec)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The type of VPN method implemented is based on the access requirements of the users and the organizationâ€™s IT processes.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Both IPsec and SSL VPN technologies offer access to virtually any network application or resource. SSL VPNs offer such features as easy connectivity from non-company-managed desktops, little or no desktop software maintenance, and user-customized web portals upon login.</p>
