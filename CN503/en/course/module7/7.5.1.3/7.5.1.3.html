        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <div>
          <p>VPNs are used to create a secure end-to-end private network connection over a third party network, such as the Internet. A site-to-site VPN uses a VPN gateway device at the edge of both sites. The end hosts are unaware of the VPN and have no additional supporting software.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A remote-access VPN requires software to be installed on the individual host device that accesses the network from a remote location. The two types of remote-access VPNs are SSL and IPsec. SSL technology can provide remote access using a client’s web browser and the browser’s native SSL encryption. Using Cisco AnyConnect software on the client, users can have LAN-like, full network access using SSL.</p>
          <p>GRE is a basic, non-secure site-to-site VPN tunneling protocol that can encapsulate a wide variety of protocol packet types inside IP tunnels, thus allowing an organization to deliver other protocols through an IP-based WAN. Today it is primarily used to deliver IP multicast traffic or IPv6 traffic over an IPv4 unicast-only connection.</p>
          <p>IPsec, an IETF standard, is a secure tunnel operating at Layer 3 of the OSI model that can protect and authenticate IP packets between IPsec peers. It can provide confidentiality by using encryption, data integrity, authentication, and anti-replay protection. Data integrity is provided by using a hash algorithm, such as MD5 or SHA. Authentication is provided by the PSK or RSA peer authentication method.</p>
          <p>The level of confidentiality provided by encryption depends on the algorithm used and the key length. Encryption can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. DH is a method used to securely exchange the keys to encrypt data.</p>
