        <h1>Software Troubleshooting Tools</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A wide variety of software and hardware tools are available to make troubleshooting easier. These tools may be used to gather and analyze symptoms of network problems. They often provide monitoring and reporting functions that can be used to establish the network baseline.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Common software troubleshooting tools include:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Network Management System Tools</b>
          </p>
          <p>Network management system (NMS) tools include device-level monitoring, configuration, and fault-management tools. Figure 1 shows an example display from the “WhatsUp Gold” NMS software. These tools can be used to investigate and correct network problems. Network monitoring software graphically displays a physical view of network devices, allowing network managers to monitor remote devices without actually physically checking them. Device management software provides dynamic status, statistics, and configuration information for switched products. Examples of other commonly used network management tools are CiscoView, HPBTO Software (formerly OpenView), and SolarWinds. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Knowledge Bases</b>
          </p>
          <p>On-line network device vendor knowledge bases have become indispensable sources of information. When vendor-based knowledge bases are combined with Internet search engines like Google, a network administrator has access to a vast pool of experience-based information. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 shows the Cisco <b>Tools & Resources</b> page found at <a href="http://www.cisco.com/" target="_blank">http://www.cisco.com</a>. This is a free tool providing information on Cisco-related hardware and software. It contains troubleshooting procedures, implementation guides, and original white papers on most aspects of networking technology.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Baselining Tools</b>
          </p>
          <p>Many tools for automating the network documentation and baselining process are available. These tools are available for Windows, Linux, and AUX operating systems. Figure 3 shows a screen capture of the SolarWinds LANsurveyor and CyberGauge software. Baselining tools help with common documentation tasks. For example, they can draw network diagrams, help keep network software and hardware documentation up-to-date, and help to cost-effectively measure baseline network bandwidth use.</p>
