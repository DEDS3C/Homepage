        <h1>Public and Private IPv4 Addresses</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Public IPv4 addresses are addresses which are globally routed between ISP (Internet Service Provider) routers. However, not all available IPv4 addresses can be used on the Internet. There are blocks of addresses called <i>private addresses</i> that are used by most organizations to assign IPv4 addresses to internal hosts. </p>
          <p>In the mid-1990s private IPv4 addresses were introduced because of the depletion of IPv4 address space. Private IPv4 addresses are not unique and can be used by an internal network.</p>
          <p>Specifically, the private address blocks are:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>10.0.0.0 /8</b>  or <b>10.0.0.0</b> to <b>10.255.255.</b><b>255</b></li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>172.16.0.0 /12</b> or <b>172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255</b></li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>192.168.0.0 /16</b> or <b>192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255</b></li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>It is important to know that addresses within these address blocks are not allowed on the Internet and must be filtered (discarded) by Internet routers. For example, in the figure, users in networks 1, 2, or 3 are sending packets to remote destinations. The Internet Service Provider (ISP) routers would see that the source IPv4 addresses in the packets are from private addresses and would, therefore, discard the packets.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Private addresses are defined in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918" target="_blank">RFC 1918</a>. </p>
          <p>Most organizations use private IPv4 addresses for their internal hosts. However, these RFC 1918 address are not routable in the Internet and must be translated to a public IPv4 address. Network Address Translation (NAT) is used to translate between private IPv4 and public IPv4 addresses. This is usually done on the router that connects the internal network to the ISP's network. </p>
          <p>Home routers provide the same capability. For instance, most home routers assign IPv4 addresses to their wired and wireless hosts from the private address of 192.168.1.0 /24. The home router interface that connects to the Internet service provider (ISP) network is assigned a public IPv4 address to use on the Internet.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows three separate networks. Each is connected to its own ISP router. The ISP routers are connected to the Internet. The networks are privately addressed. In the figure, each router is sending a privately addressed packet to its ISP router. Each ISP router has a red X over the link signifying that the router will not accept the packet.</div>
