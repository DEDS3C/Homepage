        <h1>Multicast Transmission</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Multicast transmission reduces traffic by allowing a host to send a single packet to a selected set of hosts that subscribe to a multicast group. </p>
          <p>IPv4 has reserved the 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 addresses as a multicast range. The IPv4 multicast addresses 224.0.0.0 to 224.0.0.255 are reserved for multicasting on the local network only. These addresses are to be used for multicast groups on a local network. A router connected to the local network recognizes that these packets are addressed to a local network multicast group and never forwards them further. A typical use of reserved local network multicast address is in routing protocols using multicast transmission to exchange routing information. For instance, 224.0.0.9 is the multicast address used by Routing Information Protocol (RIP) version 2 to communicate with other RIPv2 routers.</p>
          <p>Hosts that receive particular multicast data are called multicast clients. The multicast clients use services requested by a client program to subscribe to the multicast group. </p>
          <p>Each multicast group is represented by a single IPv4 multicast destination address. When an IPv4 host subscribes to a multicast group, the host processes packets addressed to this multicast address, and packets addressed to its uniquely allocated unicast address. </p>
          <p>The animation demonstrates clients accepting multicast packets.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure is an animation of a multicast transmission.  A PC with the IP address 172.16.4.1 is sending a multicast message to the multicast address of 224.10.10.5.  Two of the devices on the network are members of this multicast group and they each receive a copy of the frame.</div>
