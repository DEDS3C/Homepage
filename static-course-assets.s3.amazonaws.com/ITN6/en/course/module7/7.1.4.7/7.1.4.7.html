        <h1>Assignment of IP Addresses</h1>
        <div>
          <p>For a company or organization to support network hosts, such as web servers accessible from the Internet, that organization must have a block of public addresses assigned. Remember that public addresses must be unique, and use of these public addresses is regulated and allocated to each organization separately. This is true for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. </p>
          <p>Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) (<a href="http://www.iana.org/" target="_blank">http://www.iana.org</a>). The IANA manages and allocates blocks of IP addresses to the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). Click each of the RIRs in the figure to view more information.</p>
          <p>RIRs are responsible for allocating IP addresses to ISPs who in turn provide IPv4 address blocks to organizations and smaller ISPs. Organizations can get their addresses directly from an RIR subject to the policies of that RIR.</p>
