        <h1>Classless Addressing</h1>
        <div>
          <p>As shown in the figure, the classful system allocated 50% of the available IPv4 addresses to 128 Class A networks, 25% of the addresses to Class B and then Class C shared the remaining 25% with Class D and E. The problem is that this wasted a great deal of addresses and exhausted the availability of IPv4 addresses. Not all organizations' requirements fit well into one of these three classes. For example, a company that had a network with 260 hosts would need to be given a class B address with more than 65,000 addresses wasting 64,740 addresses. </p>
          <p>Classful addressing was abandoned in the late 1990s for the newer and current classless addressing system. However, there are still classful remnants in networks today. For example, when you assign an IPv4 address to a computer, the operating system examines the address being assigned to determine if this address is a class A, class B, or class C. The operating system then assumes the prefix used by that class and makes the default subnet mask assignment. </p>
          <p>The system in use today is referred to as <i>classless addressing</i>. The formal name is Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR, pronounced “cider”). In 1993, the IETF created a new set of standards that allowed service providers to allocate IPv4 addresses on any address bit boundary (prefix length) instead of only by a class A, B, or C address. This was to help delay the depletion and eventual exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.</p>
          <p>The IETF knew that CIDR was only a temporary solution and that a new IP protocol would have to be developed to accommodate the rapid growth in the number of Internet users. In 1994, the IETF began its work to find a successor to IPv4, which eventually became IPv6.</p>
          <p>So who manages and assigns these IP addresses?</p>
