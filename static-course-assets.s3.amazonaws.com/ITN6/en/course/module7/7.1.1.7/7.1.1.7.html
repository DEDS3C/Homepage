        <h1>Decimal to Binary Conversion Examples</h1>
        <div>
          <p>To help understand the process, consider the IP address 192.168.11.10. Using the previously explained process, start with the binary positional value table and the first decimal number 192.</p>
          <p>Figure 1 illustrates how 192 is compared to see if it is equal to or greater than the high-order bit 128. Because 192 is greater than 128, add a 1 to the high-order positional value to represent 128. Then subtract 128 from 192 to produce a remainder of 64. Figure 2 then compares 64 to the next high-order bit 64. Because they are equal, add a 1 to next high-order positional value. Enter binary 0 in the remainder of the positional values as shown in Figure 3. The binary value of the first octet is 11000000.</p>
          <p>The next octet is 168. Figure 4 compares 168 to the 128 high-order bit. Because 168 is greater than 128, add a 1 to the high-order positional value. Then subtract 128 from 168 to produce a remainder of 40. Figure 5 then compares 40 to the next high-order bit 64. Because 40 is less, add a 0 to the next high-order positional value of 64. Figure 6 compares the next high-order bit 32. Because 40 is greater than 32, add a 1 to the positional value, and subtract 32 from 40 to produce a remainder of 8. Eight matches a specific positional value. Therefore, enter a 0 for the positional value of 16 and add a 1 to the positional value of 8, as shown in Figure 7. Add 0s to all remaining positional values. As shown in Figure 8, the binary value of the third octet is 10101000.</p>
          <p>The third octet is 10. It is possible to bypass the process of subtraction with easier or smaller decimal numbers. For instance, Figure 9 displays the converted binary number. Notice that it would be fairly easy to calculate this number without actually going through the subtraction process (8 + 2 = 10). The binary value of the second octet is 00001010. </p>
          <p>The fourth octet is 11 (8 + 2 + 1). As shown in Figure 10, the binary value of the fourth octet is 00001011.</p>
          <p>Converting between binary and decimal may seem challenging at first, but with practice it should become easier over time.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figures 1 through 10 show an example of determining the binary value for an IP address. Converting the first octet is shown in the first seven figures. Figure 8 shows the conversion of the second octet. Figure 9 shows the conversion of the third octet. Figure 10 shows the conversion of the fourth octet.</div>
