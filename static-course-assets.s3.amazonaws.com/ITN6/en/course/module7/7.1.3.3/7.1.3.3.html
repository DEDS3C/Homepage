        <h1>IPv4 Communication</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A host successfully connected to a network can communicate with other devices in one of three ways:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Unicast</b> - The process of sending a packet from one host to an individual host as shown in Figure 1.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Broadcast</b> - The process of sending a packet from one host to all hosts in the network as shown in Figure 2.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Multicast</b> - The process of sending a packet from one host to a selected group of hosts, possibly in different networks, as shown in Figure 3.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>These three types of communication are used for different purposes in data networks. In all three cases, the IPv4 address of the originating host is placed in the packet header as the source address. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 is an animation showing a unicast transmission.  A PC with the IP address 172.16.4.1 needs to send a packet to a network printer at 172.16.4.253.  The packet is sent to a switch and then the packet is forwarded onl to the printer. Figure 2 is an animation showing a broadcast transmission.  A PC with the IP address 172.16.4.1 is sending a broadcast message to all the other devices.  The switch receives the frame and sends it out all other ports except for the port from which it received the frame. Figure 3 is an animation of a multicast transmission.  A PC with the IP address 172.16.4.1 is sending a multicast message to the multicast address of 224.10.10.5.  Two of the devices on the network are members of this multicast group and they each receive a copy of the frame.</div>
