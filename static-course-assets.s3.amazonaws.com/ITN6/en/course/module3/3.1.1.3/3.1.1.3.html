        <h1>Message Encoding</h1>
        <div>
          <p>One of the first steps to sending a message is encoding. Encoding is the process of converting information into another acceptable form, for transmission. Decoding reverses this process in order to interpret the information. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Imagine a person planning a holiday trip with a friend, and calling the friend to discuss the details of where they want to go, as shown in Figure 1. To communicate the message, she converts her thoughts into an agreed upon language. She then speaks the words using the sounds and inflections of spoken language that convey the message. Her friend listens to the description and decodes the sounds to understand the message he received. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Encoding also occurs in computer communication, as shown in Figure 2. Encoding between hosts must be in an appropriate format for the medium. Messages sent across the network are first converted into bits by the sending host. Each bit is encoded into a pattern of sounds, light waves, or electrical impulses depending on the network media over which the bits are transmitted. The destination host receives and decodes the signals in order to interpret the message.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 is an animation of the communication process between two people.   A woman is thinking of a message, she formulates the message and transmits it to a man who receives the message.  This is used to demonstrate the communication process. Figure 2 is an animation of the communication process between two computers.   A data packet is formed on a computer and then the message is transmitted to a receiving computer.</div>
