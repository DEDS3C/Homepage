          <p>The first packet switching network and predecessor to todayâ€™s Internet was the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), which came to life in 1969 by connecting mainframe computers at four locations. ARPANET was funded by the U.S. Department of Defense for use by universities and research laboratories. </p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure is a timeline that shows the evolution of the Internet starting from 1965.  A few highlights in time are listed.  In 1969 the first messages were transmitted from the University of California Los Angeles Stanford Research Institute.  In 1981 the TCP and IP protocols were formalized.  In 1984, the Domain Name Service was introduced.  In 1985 the file transfer protocol was documented.  In 1986 Cisco launched its first routing innovation, which was a multiprotocol router.  In 1993 the first web browser was developed by Mr. Marc Andreessen at the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana and was called MOSAIC.  June 8 of two thousand eleven was the first World IP version 6 day.</div>
