        <h1>OSI Model and TCP/IP Model Comparison</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The protocols that make up the TCP/IP protocol suite can also be described in terms of the OSI reference model. In the OSI model, the network access layer and the application layer of the TCP/IP model are further divided to describe discrete functions that must occur at these layers. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>At the network access layer, the TCP/IP protocol suite does not specify which protocols to use when transmitting over a physical medium; it only describes the handoff from the internet layer to the physical network protocols. OSI Layers 1 and 2 discuss the necessary procedures to access the media and the physical means to send data over a network.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>OSI Layer 3, the network layer, maps directly to the TCP/IP Internet layer. This layer is used to describe protocols that address and route messages through an internetwork.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>OSI Layer 4, the transport layer, maps directly to the TCP/IP Transport layer. This layer describes general services and functions that provide ordered and reliable delivery of data between source and destination hosts.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The TCP/IP application layer includes a number of protocols that provide specific functionality to a variety of end user applications. The OSI model Layers 5, 6, and 7 are used as references for application software developers and vendors to produce products that operate on networks.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Both the TCP/IP and OSI models are commonly used when referring to protocols at various layers. Because the OSI model separates the data link layer from the physical layer, it is commonly used when referring to these lower layers.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure lines up the two models and shows the correlation between layers.  The application, presentation and session layers of the OSI model line up with the Application layer of TCP/IP model.  The Transport layers align together.  The OSI network layer aligns with the Internet layer of TCP/IP and the OSI data link and physical align with the TCP/IP network access layer.</div>
