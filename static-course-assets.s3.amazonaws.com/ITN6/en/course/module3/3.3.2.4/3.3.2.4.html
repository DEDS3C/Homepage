        <h1>Devices on a Remote Network</h1>
        <div>
          <p>But what are the roles of the network layer address and the data link layer address when a device is communicating with a device on a remote network? In this example we have a client computer, PC1, communicating with a server, named Web Server, on a different IP network.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Role of the Network Layer Addresses</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When the sender of the packet is on a different network from the receiver, the source and destination IP addresses will represent hosts on different networks. This will be indicated by the network portion of the IP address of the destination host.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Source IP address</b> - The IP address of the sending device, the client computer PC1: 192.168.1.110.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Destination IP address</b> - The IP address of the receiving device, the server, Web Server: 172.16.1.99.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Notice in the figure that the network portion of the source IP address and destination IP address are on different networks.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Role of the Data Link Layer Addresses</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>When the sender and receiver of the IP packet are on different networks, the Ethernet data link frame cannot be sent directly to the destination host because the host is not directly reachable in the network of the sender. The Ethernet frame must be sent to another device known as the router or default gateway. In our example, the default gateway is R1. R1 has an Ethernet data link address that is on the same network as PC1. This allows PC1 to reach the router directly. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Source MAC address</b> - The Ethernet MAC address of the sending device, PC1. The MAC address of the Ethernet interface of PC1 is AA-AA-AA-AA-AA-AA.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Destination MAC address</b> - When the receiving device, the destination IP address, is on a different network from the sending device, the sending device uses the Ethernet MAC address of the default gateway or router. In this example, the destination MAC address is the MAC address of R1's Ethernet interface, 11-11-11-11-11-11.  This is the interface that is attached to the same network as PC1.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Ethernet frame with the encapsulated IP packet can now be transmitted to R1. R1 forwards the packet to the destination, Web Server. This may mean that R1 forwards the packet to another router or directly to Web Server if the destination is on a network connected to R1. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>It is important that the IP address of the default gateway be configured on each host on the local network. All packets to a destination on remote networks are sent to the default gateway. Ethernet MAC addresses and the default gateway are discussed in later chapters.</p>
