        <h1>Fiber-Optic Connectors</h1>
        <div>
          <p>An optical fiber connector terminates the end of an optical fiber. A variety of optical fiber connectors are available. The main differences among the types of connectors are dimensions and methods of coupling. Businesses decide on the types of connectors that will be used, based on their equipment.  </p>
          <p>Click each connector in Figure 1 to learn about the three most popular types of fiber-optic connectors, ST, SC, and LC. </p>
          <p>Because light can only travel in one direction over optical fiber, two fibers are required to support the full duplex operation. Therefore, fiber-optic patch cables bundle together two optical fiber cables and terminate them with a pair of standard single fiber connectors. Some fiber connectors accept both the transmitting and receiving fibers in a single connector known as a duplex connector, as shown in the Duplex Multimode LC Connector in Figure 1. </p>
          <p>Fiber patch cords are required for interconnecting infrastructure devices. Figure 2 displays various common patch cords. The use of color distinguishes between single-mode and multimode patch cords. A yellow jacket is for single-mode fiber cables and orange (or aqua) for multimode fiber cables.</p>
          <p>Fiber cables should be protected with a small plastic cap when not in use.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows four pictures of fiber connectors.  ST, SC, LC, and duplex multimode LC connectors. Clicking each connector brings up a text box with a brief description. Figure 2 shows four pictures of fiber patch chords for each of the four connectors.</div>
