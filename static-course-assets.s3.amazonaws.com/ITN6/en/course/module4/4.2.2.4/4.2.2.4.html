        <h1>Types of UTP Cable</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Different situations may require UTP cables to be wired according to different wiring conventions. This means that the individual wires in the cable have to be connected in different orders to different sets of pins in the RJ-45 connectors. </p>
          <p>The following are the main cable types that are obtained by using specific wiring conventions:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Ethernet Straight-through</b>: The most common type of networking cable. It is commonly used to interconnect a host to a switch and a switch to a router.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Ethernet Crossover</b>: A cable used to interconnect similar devices. For example to connect a switch to a switch, a host to a host, or a router to a router.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Rollover</b>: A Cisco proprietary cable used to connect a workstation to a router or switch console port. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The figure shows the UTP cable type, related standards, and typical application of these cables. It also identifies the individual wire pairs for the TIA-568A and TIA-568B standards. </p>
          <p>Using a crossover or straight-through cable incorrectly between devices may not damage the devices, but connectivity and communication between the devices will not take place. This is a common error in the lab and checking that the device connections are correct should be the first troubleshooting action if connectivity is not achieved.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows two RJ-45 wiring standards, the T568A and the T568 B.  Below is a table showing the cable types, their application and the standards. For Ethernet straight-through cables, both ends must be the same standard. For Ethernet crossover cables, one end must be T568A and the other end must be T568B. Cisco rollover cables are proprietary.</div>
