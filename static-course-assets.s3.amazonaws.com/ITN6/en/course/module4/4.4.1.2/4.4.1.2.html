        <h1>Physical and Logical Topologies</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The topology of a network is the arrangement or relationship of the network devices and the interconnections between them. LAN and WAN topologies can be viewed in two ways:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Physical topology</b> - Refers to the physical connections and identifies how end devices and infrastructure devices such as routers, switches, and wireless access points are interconnected. Physical topologies are usually point-to-point or star. See Figure 1.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Logical topology</b> - Refers to the way a network transfers frames from one node to the next. This arrangement consists of virtual connections between the nodes of a network. These logical signal paths are defined by data link layer protocols. The logical topology of point-to-point links is relatively simple while shared media offers different access control methods. See Figure 2.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The data link layer "sees" the logical topology of a network when controlling data access to the media. It is the logical topology that influences the type of network framing and media access control used.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows a floor plan with the location of each network drop and where it is on the floor plan.  This is called a physical topology. Figure 2 shows a router that has two interfaces each connected to a LAN.  Each LAN has a network address. Intermediary devices are labelled with port numbers. LANs are labelled with the network address. This is called a logical topology.</div>
