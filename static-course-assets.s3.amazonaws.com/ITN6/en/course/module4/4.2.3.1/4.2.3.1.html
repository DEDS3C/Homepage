        <h1>Properties of Fiber-Optic Cabling</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Optical fiber cable transmits data over longer distances and at higher bandwidths than any other networking media. Unlike copper wires, fiber-optic cable can transmit signals with less attenuation and is completely immune to EMI and RFI. Optical fiber is commonly used to interconnect network devices.</p>
          <p>Optical fiber is a flexible, but extremely thin, transparent strand of very pure glass, not much bigger than a human hair. Bits are encoded on the fiber as light impulses. The fiber-optic cable acts as a waveguide, or “light pipe,” to transmit light between the two ends with minimal loss of signal. </p>
          <p>As an analogy, consider an empty paper towel roll with the inside coated like a mirror. It is a thousand meters in length, and a small laser pointer is used to send Morse code signals at the speed of light. Essentially that is how a fiber-optic cable operates, except that it is smaller in diameter and uses sophisticated light technologies. </p>
          <p>Fiber-optic cabling is now being used in four types of industry:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Enterprise Networks</b>: Used for backbone cabling applications and interconnecting infrastructure devices.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH)</b>: Used to provide always-on broadband services to homes and small businesses. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Long-Haul Networks</b>: Used by service providers to connect countries and cities. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Submarine Cable Networks</b>: Used to provide reliable high-speed, high-capacity solutions capable of surviving in harsh undersea environments up to transoceanic distances.

          <p>Our focus in this course is the use of fiber within the enterprise.</p>
