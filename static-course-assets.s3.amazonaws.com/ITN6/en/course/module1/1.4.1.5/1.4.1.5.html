        <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Cloud computing is another global trend changing the way we access and store data. Cloud computing allows us to store personal files, even backup our entire hard disk drive on servers over the Internet. Applications such as word processing and photo editing can be accessed using the Cloud. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For businesses, Cloud computing extends IT's capabilities without requiring investment in new infrastructure, training new personnel, or licensing new software. These services are available on demand and delivered economically to any device anywhere in the world without compromising security or function. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are four primary types of Clouds, as shown in the figure: Public Clouds, Private Clouds, Hybrid Clouds, and Custom Clouds. Click each Cloud to learn more.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Cloud computing is possible because of data centers. A data center is a facility used to house computer systems and associated components. A data center can occupy one room of a building, one or more floors, or an entire building. Data centers are typically very expensive to build and maintain. For this reason, only large organizations use privately built data centers to house their data and provide services to users. Smaller organizations that cannot afford to maintain their own private data center can reduce the overall cost of ownership by leasing server and storage services from a larger data center organization in the Cloud.</p>
