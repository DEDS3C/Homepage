        <h1>Online Collaboration</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Individuals want to connect to the network, not only for access to data applications, but also to collaborate with one another. Collaboration is defined as “the act of working with another or others on a joint project.” Collaboration tools, like Cisco WebEx shown in the figure, give employees, students, teachers, customers, and partners a way to instantly connect, interact, and achieve their objectives.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For businesses, collaboration is a critical and strategic priority that organizations are using to remain competitive. Collaboration is also a priority in education. Students need to collaborate to assist each other in learning, to develop team skills used in the work force, and to work together on team-based projects.</p>
