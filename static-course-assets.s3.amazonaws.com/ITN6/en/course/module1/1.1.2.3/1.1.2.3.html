          <p>Client and server software usually runs on separate computers, but it is also possible for one computer to carry out both roles at the same time. In small businesses and homes, many computers function as the servers and clients on the network. This type of network is called a peer-to-peer network. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The advantages and disadvantages of peer-to-peer networking are shown in the figure.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows two PCs connected. One PC is also connected to a printer and is sharing the printer with the other PC. The figure also lists the advantages and disadvantages of a peer to peer network.  The advantages are they are easy to set up, they have less complexity, they are lower cost because network devices and dedicated servers may not be required, and they can be used for simple tasks such as transferring files and sharing printers.  The disadvantages are they have no centralized administration, they are not as secure, they are not scalable, and all devices may act as both clients and servers which can slow their performance.</div>
