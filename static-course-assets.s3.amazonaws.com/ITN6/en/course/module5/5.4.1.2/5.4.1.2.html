        <h1>Chapter 5: Ethernet</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Ethernet is the most widely used LAN technology today. It is a family of networking technologies that are defined in the IEEE 802.2 and 802.3 standards. Ethernet standards define both the Layer 2 protocols and the Layer 1 technologies. For the Layer 2 protocols, as with all 802 IEEE standards, Ethernet relies on the two separate sublayers of the data link layer to operate, the Logical Link Control (LLC) and the MAC sublayers.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>At the data link layer, the frame structure is nearly identical for all bandwidths of Ethernet. The Ethernet frame structure adds headers and trailers around the Layer 3 PDU to encapsulate the message being sent. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>There are two styles of Ethernet framing: IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard and the DIX Ethernet standard which is now referred to Ethernet II. The most significant difference between the two standards is the addition of a Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) and the change of the Type field to a Length field in the 802.3. Ethernet II is the Ethernet frame format used in TCP/IP networks. As an implementation of the IEEE 802.2/3 standards, the Ethernet frame provides MAC addressing and error checking. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The Layer 2 addressing provided by Ethernet supports unicast, multicast, and broadcast communications. Ethernet uses the Address Resolution Protocol to determine the MAC addresses of destinations and map them against known IPv4 addresses.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Each node on an IPv4 network has both a MAC address and an IPv4 address. The IP addresses are used to identify the original source and final destination of the packet. The Ethernet MAC addresses are used to send the packet from one Ethernet NIC to another Ethernet NIC on the same IP network. ARP is used to map a known IPv4 address to a MAC address, so the packet can be encapsulated in an Ethernet frame with the correct Layer 2 address.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>ARP relies on certain types of Ethernet broadcast messages and Ethernet unicast messages, called ARP requests and ARP replies. The ARP protocol resolves IPv4 addresses to MAC addresses and maintains a table of mappings.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>On most Ethernet networks, end devices are typically connected on a point-to-point basis to a Layer 2, full-duplex switch. A Layer 2 LAN switch performs switching and filtering based only on the OSI data link layer (Layer 2) MAC address. A Layer 2 switch builds a MAC address table that it uses to make forwarding decisions. Layer 2 switches depend on routers to pass data between independent IP subnetworks.</p>
