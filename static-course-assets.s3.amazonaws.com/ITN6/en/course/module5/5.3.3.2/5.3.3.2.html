        <h1>ARP Spoofing</h1>
        <div>
          <p>In some cases, the use of ARP can lead to a potential security risk known as ARP spoofing or ARP poisoning. This is a technique used by an attacker to reply to an ARP request for an IPv4 address belonging to another device, such as the default gateway, as shown in the figure. The attacker sends an ARP reply with its own MAC address. The receiver of the ARP reply will add the wrong MAC address to its ARP table and send these packets to the attacker. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Enterprise level switches include mitigation techniques known as dynamic ARP inspection (DAI). DAI is beyond the scope of this course.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows three PCs connected to a switch. The switch is connected to router 1. Router 1 is connected to a cloud labeled “network”. PC A is sending an ARP request for the MAC address of the default gateway. PC C intercepts the request and sends back an ARP reply, pretending to be the default gateway, router 1.</div>
