            <b>Resolving IPv4 Addresses to MAC Addresses</b>
          </p>
          <p>When a packet is sent to the data link layer to be encapsulated into an Ethernet frame, the device refers to a table in its memory to find the MAC address that is mapped to the IPv4 address. This table is called the ARP table or the ARP cache. The ARP table is stored in the RAM of the device. </p>
          <p>The sending device will search its ARP table for a destination IPv4 address and a corresponding MAC address. </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>If the packetâ€™s destination IPv4 address is on the same network as the source IPv4 address, the device will search the ARP table for the destination IPv4 address. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>If the destination IPv4 address is on a different network than the source IPv4 address, the device will search the ARP table for the IPv4 address of the default gateway. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>In both cases, the search is for an IPv4 address and a corresponding MAC address for the device. </p>
          <p>Each entry, or row, of the ARP table binds an IPv4 address with a MAC address. We call the relationship between the two values a map - it simply means that you can locate an IPv4 address in the table and discover the corresponding MAC address. The ARP table temporarily saves (caches) the mapping for the devices on the LAN. </p>
          <p>If the device locates the IPv4 address, its corresponding MAC address is used as the destination MAC address in the frame. If there is no entry is found, then the device sends an ARP request.</p>
