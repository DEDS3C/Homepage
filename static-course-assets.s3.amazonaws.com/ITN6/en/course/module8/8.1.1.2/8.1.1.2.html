        <h1>Problems with Large Broadcast Domains</h1>
        <div>
          <p>A large broadcast domain is a network that connects many hosts. A problem with a large broadcast domain is that these hosts can generate excessive broadcasts and negatively affect the network. In Figure 1, LAN 1 connects 400 users that could generate broadcast traffic resulting in:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Slow network operations due to the significant amount of traffic it can cause </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Slow device operations because a device must accept and process each broadcast packet</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>The solution is to reduce the size of the network to create smaller broadcast domains in a process called <i>subnetting</i>. These smaller network spaces are called <i>subnets</i>. </p>
          <p>In Figure 2 for example, the 400 users in LAN 1 with network address 172.16.0.0 /16 have been divided into two subnets of 200 users each; 172.16.0.0 /24 and 172.16.1.0 /24. Broadcasts are only propagated within the smaller broadcast domains. Therefore a broadcast in LAN 1 would not propagate to LAN 2. </p>
          <p>Notice how the prefix length has changed from a /16 to a /24. This is the basis of subnetting; using host bits to create additional subnets. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: The terms <i>subnet</i> and <i>network</i> are often used interchangeably. Most networks are a subnet of some larger address block.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows a router connected to the Internet and to another switch. The switch is connected to three other switches. A box encompasses all the switches and the router interface and is labeled “LAN1: 172.16.0.0/16 (400 users)”. Figure 2 shows a router connected to the Internet and two switches. Each switch is its on LAN with 200 users each.</div>
