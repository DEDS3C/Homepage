        <h1>Creating 1000 Subnets with a /8 Network</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Some organizations, such as small service providers or large enterprises, may need even more subnets. Take, for example, a small ISP that requires 1000 subnets for its clients. Each client will need plenty of space in the host portion to create their own subnets.</p>
          <p>The network address 10.0.0.0 has a default subnet mask of 255.0.0.0 or /8. This means there are 8 bits in the network portion and 24 host bits available to borrow toward subnetting. Therefore, the small ISP will subnet the 10.0.0.0/8 network.</p>
          <p>As always, in order to create subnets we must borrow bits from the host portion of the IP address of the existing internetwork. Starting from the left to the right with the first available host bit, we will borrow a single bit at a time until we reach the number of bits necessary to create 1000 subnets. As shown in Figure 1, we need to borrow 10 bits to create 1024 subnets. Specifically, we need to borrow the 8 bits in the second octet and 2 additional bits from the third octet.</p>
          <p>Figure 2 displays the network address and the resulting subnet mask which converts to 255.255.192.0 or a /18 prefix. </p>
          <p>Figure 3 displays the resulting subnets of borrowing 10 bits creating subnets from 10.0.0.0 /18 to 10.255.255.128.0 /18.</p>
          <p>Figure 4 displays that 14 host bits were not borrowed, therefore, 2^14 - 2 = 16382.  This indicates that each of the 1000 subnets can support up to 16,382 hosts.</p>
          <p>Figure 5 displays the specifics of the first subnet.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows the formula for calculating the number of subnets based on the bits borrowed from 1 bit borrowed all the way to 10 bits borrowed. Borrowing 10 bits gets you 2 to the power of 10 or 1024 subnets. Figure 2 shows the network address 10.0.0.0/18. The last three octets are in binary. The subnet mask is shown below the network address with the ten bits borrowed are now shown as one bits. Figure 3 shows the first five subnets and the last subnet created by borrowing 10 bits. The last three octets are shown in binary. Figure 4 shows the formula for calculating the number of valid hosts, which is 2 to the power of 14 minus 2 or 16,382. Figure 5 shows the network address, first host address, last host address, and broadcast address for the 10.0.0.0/18 subnet.</div>
