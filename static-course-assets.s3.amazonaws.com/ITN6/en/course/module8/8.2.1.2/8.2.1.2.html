        <h1>Planning to Address the Network</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Three primary considerations for planning address allocation are displayed in the figure. </p>
          <p>Preventing the duplication of addresses refers to the fact that each host in an internetwork must have a unique address. Without the proper planning and documentation, an address could be assigned to more than one host, resulting in access issues for both hosts.</p>
          <p>Providing and controlling access refers to the fact that some hosts, such as servers, provide resources to internal hosts as well as to external hosts. The Layer 3 address assigned to a server can be used to control access to that server. If, however, the address is randomly assigned and not well documented, controlling access is more difficult. </p>
          <p>Monitoring security and performance of hosts means network traffic is examined for source IP addresses that are generating or receiving excessive packets. If there is proper planning and documentation of the network addressing, problematic network devices should easily be found. </p>
