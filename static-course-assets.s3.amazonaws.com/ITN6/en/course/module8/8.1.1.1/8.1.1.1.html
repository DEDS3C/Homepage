        <h1>Broadcast Domains</h1>
        <div>
          <p>In an Ethernet LAN, devices use broadcasts to locate:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Other devices</b> – A device uses Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) which sends Layer 2 broadcasts to a known IPv4 address on the local network to discover the associated MAC address. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Services – </b>A host typically acquires its IPv4 address configuration using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) which sends broadcasts on the local network to locate a DHCP server.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Switches propagate broadcasts out all interfaces except the interface on which it was received. For example, if a switch in the figure were to receive a broadcast, it would forward it to the other switches and other users connected in the network.</p>
          <p>Routers do not propagate broadcasts. When a router receives a broadcast, it does not forward it out other interfaces. For instance, when R1 receives a broadcast on its Gigabit Ethernet 0/0 interface, it does not forward out another interface. </p>
          <p>Therefore, each router interface connects a <i>broadcast domain</i> and broadcasts are only propagated within its specific broadcast domain.</p>
