        <h1>Role of the Transport Layer</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The transport layer is responsible for establishing a temporary communication session between two applications and delivering data between them. An application generates data that is sent from an application on a source host to an application on a destination host. This is without regard to the destination host type, the type of media over which the data must travel, the path taken by the data, the congestion on a link, or the size of the network. As shown in the figure, the transport layer is the link between the application layer and the lower layers that are responsible for network transmission.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows the four layers of the TCP/IP model and how it enables applications on devices to communicate.  The figure highlights the Transport layer, which is responsible for moving data between applications on devices in the network.  The transport layer on the sending device corresponds with the transport layer of the receiving device.</div>
