        <h1>Port Number Groups</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is the standards body responsible for assigning various addressing standards, including port numbers. There are different types of port numbers, as shown in Figure 1:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Well-known Ports (Numbers 0 to 1023) </b>- These numbers are reserved for services and applications. They are commonly used for applications such as web browsers, email clients, and remote access clients. By defining these well-known ports for server applications, client applications can be programmed to request a connection to that specific port and its associated service.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Registered Ports (Numbers 1024 to 49151)</b> - These port numbers are assigned by IANA to a requesting entity to use with specific processes or applications. These processes are primarily individual applications that a user has chosen to install, rather than common applications that would receive a well-known port number. For example, Cisco has registered port 1985 for its Hot Standby Routing Protocol (HSRP) process.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Dynamic or Private Ports (Numbers 49152 to 65535)</b> - Also known as ephemeral ports, these are usually assigned dynamically by the client’s OS when a connection to a service is initiated. The dynamic port is then used to identify the client application during communication.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note</b>: Some client operating systems may use registered port numbers instead of dynamic port numbers for assigning source ports.</p>
          <p>Figure 2 displays some common well-known port numbers and their associated applications. Some applications may use both TCP and UDP. For example, DNS uses UDP when clients send requests to a DNS server. However, communication between two DNS servers always uses TCP.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows the three ranges used for port numbers.  Ports 0 through 1023 are classified as well known ports.  Numbers 1024 through 49151 are registered ports.  Ports 49152 through 65535 are considered private and slash or dynamic ports. Figure 2 lists a dozen of the more common well-known port numbers including FTP (20 and 21), SSH (22), SMTP (25), DNS (53), DHCP (67 and 68), TFTP (69), HTTP (80), POP3 (110), IMAP (143), SNMP (161), and HTTPS (443).</div>
