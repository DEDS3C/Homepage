        <h1>Transport Layer Responsibilities</h1>
        <div>
          <p>
            <b>Tracking Individual Conversations</b>
          </p>
          <p>At the transport layer, each set of data flowing between a source application and a destination application is known as a conversation (Figure 1). A host may have multiple applications that are communicating across the network simultaneously. Each of these applications communicates with one or more applications on one or more remote hosts. It is the responsibility of the transport layer to maintain and track these multiple conversations.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Segmenting Data and Reassembling Segments</b>
          </p>
          <p>Data must be prepared to be sent across the media in manageable pieces. Most networks have a limitation on the amount of data that can be included in a single packet. Transport layer protocols have services that segment the application data into blocks that are an appropriate size (Figure 2). This service includes the encapsulation required on each piece of data. A header, used for reassembly, is added to each block of data. This header is used to track the data stream.</p>
          <p>At the destination, the transport layer must be able to reconstruct the pieces of data into a complete data stream that is useful to the application layer. The protocols at the transport layer describe how the transport layer header information is used to reassemble the data pieces into streams to be passed to the application layer.</p>
          <p>
            <b>Identifying the Applications </b>
          </p>
          <p>To pass data streams to the proper applications, the transport layer must identify the target application (Figure 3). To accomplish this, the transport layer assigns each application an identifier called a port number. Each software process that needs to access the network is assigned a port number unique to that host.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure 1 shows a single computer that has multiple web pages open along with an instant messaging window, an e-mail application, a streaming video application and a VoIP phone application running.  This represents that a computer typically has more than one process running any one time and it is the transport layer that tracks each individual conversation flowing between a source application and a destination application separately. Figure 2 shows a series of data blocks being transmitted to the computer.  The data blocks are of varying colors which correspond to different services. Figure 3 shows the computer sending the packages to the proper application, the web browser, the e-mail client, the streaming video application or the VoIP phone.  Each application has a specific data block color.  This represents the computer sorting the data based on application. Figure four shows the setup and termination of a data transfer session between a host and a server.</div>
