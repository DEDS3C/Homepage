        <h1>TCP Server Processes</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Each application process running on the server is configured to use a port number, either by default or manually, by a system administrator. An individual server cannot have two services assigned to the same port number within the same transport layer services. </p>
          <p>For example, a host running a web server application and a file transfer application cannot have both configured to use the same port (for example, TCP port 80). An active server application assigned to a specific port is considered to be open, which means that the transport layer accepts and processes segments addressed to that port. Any incoming client request addressed to the correct socket is accepted, and the data is passed to the server application. There can be many ports open simultaneously on a server, one for each active server application. </p>
          <p>Refer to Figures 1 through 5 to see the typical allocation of source and destination ports in TCP client/server operations.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows a server running both an HTTP server on port 80 and SMTP server running on port 25.  The figure has two clients accessing the server.  Client 1 is sending an HTTP request from source port 49152 to destination port 80.  Client 2 is sending an SMTP request from source port 51152 to destination port 25.  This demonstrates how port numbers are used to differentiate between multiple services running on one server. Figure two highlights the use of the well-known ports for the services. Figure three highlights the use of random source ports as the source ports. Figure four highlights the response from the server to each of the two requests and the fact that the server uses the source port from the request packet as the destination. Figure five highlights the new destination port.</div>
