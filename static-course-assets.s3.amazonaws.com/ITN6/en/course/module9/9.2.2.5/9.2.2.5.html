        <h1>TCP Flow Control - Congestion Avoidance</h1>
        <div>
          <p>When congestion occurs on a network, it results in packets being discarded by the overloaded router. When packets containing TCP segments don’t reach their destination, they are left unacknowledged. By determining the rate at which TCP segments are sent but not acknowledged, the source can assume a certain level of network congestion.  </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Whenever there is congestion, retransmission of lost TCP segments from the source will occur. If the retransmission is not properly controlled, the additional retransmission of the TCP segments can make the congestion even worse. Not only are new packets with TCP segments introduced into the network, but the feedback effect of the retransmitted TCP segments that were lost will also add to the congestion. To avoid and control congestion, TCP employs several congestion handling mechanisms, timers, and algorithms. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>If the source determines that the TCP segments are either not being acknowledged or not acknowledged in a timely manner, then it can reduce the number of bytes it sends before receiving an acknowledgment. Notice that it is the source that is reducing the number of unacknowledged bytes it sends and not the window size determined by the destination.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Note:</b> Explanation of actual congestion handling mechanisms, timers, and algorithms are beyond the scope of this course.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows what happens when some segments get lost. PC 1 sends segments 1, 2, 3, and 4. Segments 2 and 3 were lost. PC B sends ACKs for 1 and 2. PC A says “I’m not getting the acknowledgments I expect for PC B so I will reduce the number of bytes I send before getting an acknowledgment.”</div>
