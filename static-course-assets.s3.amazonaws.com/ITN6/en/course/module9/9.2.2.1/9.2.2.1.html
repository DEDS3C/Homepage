        <h1>TCP Reliability - Ordered Delivery</h1>
        <div>
          <p>TCP segments may arrive at their destination out of order. For the original message to be understood by the recipient, the data in these segments is reassembled into the original order. Sequence numbers are assigned in the header of each packet to achieve this goal. The sequence number represents the first data byte of the TCP segment.</p>
          <p>During session setup, an initial sequence number (ISN) is set. This ISN represents the starting value of the bytes for this session that is transmitted to the receiving application. As data is transmitted during the session, the sequence number is incremented by the number of bytes that have been transmitted. This data byte tracking enables each segment to be uniquely identified and acknowledged. Missing segments can then be identified. </p>
          <p>
            <b>Note:</b> The ISN does not begin at one but is effectively a random number. This is to prevent certain types of malicious attacks. For simplicity, we will use an ISN of 1 for the examples in this chapter.</p>
          <p>Segment sequence numbers indicate how to reassemble and reorder received segments, as shown in the figure. </p>
          <p>The receiving TCP process places the data from a segment into a receiving buffer. Segments are placed in the proper sequence order and passed to the application layer when reassembled. Any segments that arrive with sequence numbers that are out of order are held for later processing. Then, when the segments with the missing bytes arrive, these segments are processed in order.</p>

      <div id="media-description">Figure shows data being divided into 6 segments, which are each labeled with a sequence number 1 through 6 and sent to remote host.  There are five routers connected with redundant links, thereby allowing multiple paths for the segments to follow.  The segments do not arrive at the destination in same order they were sent.  T.C.P. uses the sequence numbers to re-order the segments back to their original order.</div>
