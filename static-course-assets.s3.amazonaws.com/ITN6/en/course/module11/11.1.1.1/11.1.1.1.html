        <h1>Small Network Topologies</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The majority of businesses are small. It is not surprising then that the majority of networks are also small. A typical small-business network is shown in the figure.</p>
          <p>With small networks, the design of the network is usually simple. The number and type of devices included are significantly reduced compared to that of a larger network. The network topologies typically involve a single router and one or more switches. Small networks may also have wireless access points (possibly built into the router) and IP phones. As for connection to the Internet, normally a small network has a single WAN connection provided by DSL, cable, or an Ethernet connection. </p>
          <p>Managing a small network requires many of the same skills as those required for managing a larger one. The majority of work is focused on maintenance and troubleshooting of existing equipment, as well as securing devices and information on the network. The management of a small network is either done by an employee of the company or a person contracted by the company, depending on the size and type of the business.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure shows two workers connected to a switch.  There is an IP phone and a server connected to the switch.  The switch is then connected to a router.  This area is shaded and labeled LAN.  The router connects to a cloud with a serial connection labeled WAN.</div>
