        <h1>Redundancy in a Small Network</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Another important part of network design is reliability. Even small businesses often rely heavily on their network for business operation. A failure of the network can be very costly. In order to maintain a high degree of reliability, redundancy is required in the network design. Redundancy helps to eliminate single points of failure. There are many ways to accomplish redundancy in a network. Redundancy can be accomplished by installing duplicate equipment, but it can also be accomplished by supplying duplicate network links for critical areas, as shown in the figure. </p>
          <p>Small networks typically provide a single exit point toward the Internet via one or more default gateways. If the router fails, the entire network loses connectivity to the Internet. For this reason, it may be advisable for a small business to pay for a second service provider as backup.</p>

      <div id="media-description">The figure is an interactive activity that has two routers, and each are connected to a switch.  There are 3 servers, and each is connected to a switch. The switches are also connected.  This diagram is demonstrating redundant servers. When you click a device, a callout displays the function and role of the device.</div>
