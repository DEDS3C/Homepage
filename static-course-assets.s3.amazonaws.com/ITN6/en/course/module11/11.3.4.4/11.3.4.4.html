        <h1>The show ip interface brief Command</h1>
        <div>
          <p>In the same way that commands and utilities are used to verify a host configuration, commands can be used to verify the interfaces of intermediate devices. The Cisco IOS provides commands to verify the operation of router and switch interfaces.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Verifying Router Interfaces</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>One of the most frequently used commands is the <b>show ip interface brief</b> command. This command provides a more abbreviated output than the <b>show ip interface</b> command. It provides a summary of the key information for all the network interfaces on a router.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 1 shows the topology that is being used in this example.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>On Figure 2, click the R1 button. The <b>show ip interface brief</b> output displays all interfaces on the router, the IP address assigned to each interface, if any, and the operational status of the interface.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <b>Verifying the Switch Interfaces</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>On Figure 2, click the S1 button. The <b>show ip interface brief</b> command can also be used to verify the status of the switch interfaces. The VLAN1 interface is assigned an IPv4 address of 192.168.254.250 and has been enabled, and is operational.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The output also shows that the FastEthernet0/1 interface is down. This indicates that either no device is connected to the interface or the device that is connected has a network interface that is not operational. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In contrast, the output shows that the FastEthernet0/2 and FastEthernet0/3 interfaces are operational. This is indicated by both the Status and Protocol being shown as up.</p>
