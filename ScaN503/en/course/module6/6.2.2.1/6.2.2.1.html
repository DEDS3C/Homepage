        <h1>OSPF Route Summarization</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Summarization helps keep routing tables small. It involves consolidating multiple routes into a single advertisement, which can then be propagated into the backbone area. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Normally, type 1 and type 2 LSAs are generated inside each area, translated into type 3 LSAs, and sent to other areas. If area 1 had 30 networks to advertise, then 30 type 3 LSAs would be forwarded into the backbone. With route summarization, the ABR consolidates the 30 networks into one of two advertisements. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Figure 1, R1 consolidates all of the network advertisements into one summary LSA. Instead of forwarding individual LSAs for each route in area 1, R1 forwards a summary LSA to the core router C1. C1 in turn, forwards the summary LSA to R2 and R3. R2 and R3 then forward it to their respective internal routers.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Summarization also helps increase the networkâ€™s stability, because it reduces unnecessary LSA flooding. This directly affects the amount of bandwidth, CPU, and memory resources consumed by the OSPF routing process. Without route summarization, every specific-link LSA is propagated into the OSPF backbone and beyond, causing unnecessary network traffic and router overhead. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In Figure 2, a network link on R1a fails. R1a sends an LSA to R1. However, R1 does not propagate the update, because it has a summary route configured. Specific-link LSA flooding outside the area does not occur.</p>
