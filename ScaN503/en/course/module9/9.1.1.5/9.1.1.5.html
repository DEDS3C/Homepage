        <h1>Cisco IOS 15.0 M and T Trains </h1>
        <div>
          <p>Following the Cisco IOS 12.4(24)T release, the next release of Cisco IOS Software was 15.0. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>IOS 15.0 provides several enhancements to the operating system including:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>New feature and hardware support </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Broadened feature consistency with other major IOS releases</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>More predictable new feature release and rebuild schedules</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Proactive individual release support policies</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Simplified release numbering</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Clearer software deployment and migration guidelines</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As shown in the figure, Cisco IOS 15.0 uses a different release model from the traditional separate mainline and T trains of 12.4. Instead of diverging into separate trains, Cisco IOS Software 15 mainline and T will have extended maintenance release (EM release) and standard maintenance release (T release).  With the new IOS release model, Cisco IOS 15 mainline releases are referred to as M trains.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Beginning with 15.0, new releases in the form of a T train are available approximately two to three times per year. EM releases are available approximately every 16 to 20 months. T releases enable faster Cisco feature delivery before the next EM release becomes available. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>An EM release incorporates the features and hardware support of all the previous T releases. This makes newer EM releases available that contain the full functionality of the train at the time of release.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In summary, the benefits of the new Cisco IOS release model include:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Feature inheritance from Cisco IOS Software Releases 12.4T and 12.4 mainline</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>New feature releases approximately two to three times a year delivered sequentially from a single train</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>EM releases approximately every 16 to 20 months and includes new features</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>T releases for the very latest features and hardware support before next EM release becomes available on Cisco.com</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Maintenance rebuilds of M and T releases contain bug fixes only</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
