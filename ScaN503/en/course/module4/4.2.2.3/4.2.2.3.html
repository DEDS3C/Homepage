        <h1>Association Parameters </h1>
        <div>
          <p>To associate with each other, a wireless client and an AP must agree on specific parameters. Parameters must be configured on the AP and subsequently on the client to enable the negotiation of these processes. Common configurable wireless parameters include:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Network mode</b> - Refers to the 802.11 WLAN standards. APs and wireless routers can operate in a Mixed mode, as shown in Figure 1, which means that they can simultaneously use multiple standards.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>SSID</b> - An SSID is a unique identifier that wireless clients use to distinguish between multiple wireless networks in the same vicinity. If SSID broadcast is enabled, the SSID name appears in the list of available wireless networks on a client. Depending on the network configuration, several APs on a network can share an SSID. Names are usually 2 to 32 characters long. In Figure 1, the SSID is configured as <b>Home-Net</b> and SSID broadcast is enabled.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Channel settings</b> - Refers to the frequency bands being used to transmit wireless data. Wireless routers and APs can choose the channel setting or it can be set manually if there is interference with another AP or wireless device. In Figure 1, the channel is manually set to 6, which is the 2.437 GHz frequency.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Security mode</b> - Refers to the security parameter settings, such as WEP, WPA, or WPA2. Always enable the highest security level supported. For a home or small office, you would use <b>WPA2 Personal</b>, as shown in Figure 2.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Encryption</b> - WPA2 requires that you choose an encryption. Use AES whenever possible. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Password</b> - Required from the wireless client to authenticate to the AP. A password is sometimes called the security key. It prevents intruders and other unwanted users from accessing the wireless network.</li>
            </ul>
