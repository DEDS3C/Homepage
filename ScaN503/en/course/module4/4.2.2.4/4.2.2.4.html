        <h1>Discovering APs</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Wireless devices must discover and connect to an AP or wireless router. Wireless clients connect to the AP using a scanning (probing) process. This process can be:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Passive mode </b>- The AP openly advertises its service by periodically sending broadcast beacon frames containing the SSID, supported standards, and security settings. The primary purpose of the beacon is to allow wireless clients to learn which networks and APs are available in a given area, thereby allowing them to choose which network and AP to use.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Active mode </b>- Wireless clients must know the name of the SSID. The wireless client initiates the process by broadcasting a probe request frame on multiple channels. The probe request includes the SSID name and standards supported. Active mode may be required if an AP or wireless router is configured to not broadcast beacon frames.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 1 illustrates how passive mode works with the AP broadcasting a beacon frame every so often. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 2 illustrates how active mode works with a wireless client broadcasting a probe request for a specific SSID. The AP with that SSID responds with a probe response frame. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>A wireless client could also send a probe request without an SSID name to discover nearby WLAN networks. APs configured to broadcast beacon frames would respond to the wireless client with a probe response and provide the SSID name. APs with the broadcast SSID feature disabled do not respond.</p>
