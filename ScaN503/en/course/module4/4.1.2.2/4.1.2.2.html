        <h1>Wireless Home Router</h1>
        <div>
          <p>The type of infrastructure device that an end device associates and authenticates with varies based on the size and requirement of the WLAN. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>For instance, a home user typically interconnects wireless devices using a small, wireless router. The wireless router serves as:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Access point </b>- Provides 802.11a/b/g/n/ac wireless access </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Switch </b>- Provides a four-port, full-duplex, 10/100/1000 Ethernet switch to connect wired devices </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Router </b>- Provides a default gateway for connecting to other network infrastructures</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>As shown in the figure, a wireless router is commonly implemented as a small business or residential wireless access device. The wireless router connects to the ISP DLS modem and advertises its services by sending beacons containing its shared service set identifier (SSID). Internal devices wirelessly discover the router SSID and attempt to associate and authenticate with it to access the Internet. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The expected load on a wireless router, in this environment, is low enough that it should be able to manage the provision of WLAN, 802.3 Ethernet, and connect to an ISP. Most wireless routers also provide advanced features, such as high-speed access, support for video streaming, IPv6 addressing, QoS, configuration utilities, and USB ports to connect printers or portable drives. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Additionally, for home users that want to extend their network services, both wireless and wired, wireless Powerline adapters can be implemented. With these devices, a device can connect directly to the network through electrical outlets, which is ideal for HD video streaming and online gaming. They are easy to set up: simply plug into wall outlet or power strip and connect the device with a push of a button.</p>
