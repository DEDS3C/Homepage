        <h1>Passive Interface</h1>
        <div>
          <p>One reason that route tables may not reflect the correct routes is due to the<span class="cmd"><b> passive-interface </b></span>command. With EIGRP running on a network, the<span class="cmd"><b> passive-interface </b></span>command stops both outgoing and incoming routing updates. For this reason, routers do not become neighbors.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>To verify whether any interface on a router is configured as passive, use the<span class="cmd"><b> show ip protocols </b></span>command in privileged EXEC mode. Figure 1 shows that R2’s GigabitEthernet 0/0 interface is configured as a passive interface, because there are no neighbors on that link.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In addition to being configured on interfaces that have no neighbors, a passive interface can be enabled on interfaces for security purposes. In Figure 2, notice that the shading for the EIGRP routing domain is different from previous topologies. The 209.165.200.224/27 network is now included in the R2’s EIGRP updates. However, for security reasons, the network administrator does not want R2 to form an EIGRP neighbor adjacency with the ISP router.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 3 shows the addition of the 209.165.200.224/27<span class="cmd"><b> network </b></span>command on R2. R2 now advertises this network to the other routers in the EIGRP routing domain. </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The<span class="cmd"><b> passive-interface </b></span>router configuration mode command is configured on Serial 0/1/0 to prevent R2’s EIGRP updates from being sent to the ISP router. The<span class="cmd"><b> show ip eigrp neighbors </b></span>command on R2 verifies that R2 has not established a neighbor adjacency with ISP.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Figure 4 shows that R1 has an EIGRP route to the 209.165.200.224/27 network in its IPv4 routing table (R3 will also have an EIGRP route to that network in its IPv4 routing table). However, R2 does not have a neighbor adjacency with the ISP router. </p>

            <b>EIGRP for IPv6</b>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Similar commands and troubleshooting criteria also apply to EIGRP for IPv6.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>The following are the equivalent commands used with EIGRP for IPv6:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="cmd">Router# </span>
                <span class="cmd">
                  <b>show ipv6 protocols </b>
                </span>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="cmd">Router(config-rtr)# </span>
                <span class="cmd">
                  <b>passive-interface </b>
                </span>
                <span class="cmd">
                  <i>type number</i>
                </span>
              </li>
            </ul>
